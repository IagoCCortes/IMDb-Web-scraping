Morgan was born on June 1, 1937 in Memphis, Tennessee, to Mayme Edna (Revere), a teacher, and Morgan Porterfield Freeman, a barber. The young Freeman attended Los Angeles City College before serving several years in the US Air Force as a mechanic between 1955 and 1959. His first dramatic arts exposure was on the stage including appearing in an all-African American production of the exuberant musical Hello, Dolly!.Throughout the 1970s, he continued his work on stage, winning Drama Desk and Clarence Derwent Awards and receiving a Tony Award nomination for his performance in The Mighty Gents in 1978. In 1980, he won two Obie Awards, for his portrayal of Shakespearean anti-hero Coriolanus at the New York Shakespeare Festival and for his work in Mother Courage and Her Children. Freeman won another Obie in 1984 for his performance as The Messenger in the acclaimed Brooklyn Academy of Music production of Lee Breuer's The Gospel at Colonus and, in 1985, won the Drama-Logue Award for the same role. In 1987, Freeman created the role of Hoke Coleburn in Alfred Uhry's Pulitzer Prize-winning play Driving Miss Daisy, which brought him his fourth Obie Award. In 1990, Freeman starred as Petruchio in the New York Shakespeare Festival's The Taming of the Shrew, opposite Tracey Ullman. Returning to the Broadway stage in 2008, Freeman starred with Frances McDormand and Peter Gallagher in Clifford Odets' drama The Country Girl, directed by Mike Nichols.Freeman first appeared on TV screens as several characters including \"Easy Reader\", \"Mel Mounds\" and \"Count Dracula\" on the Children's Television Workshop (now Sesame Workshop) show The Electric Company (1971). He then moved into feature film with another children's adventure, Who Says I Can't Ride a Rainbow! (1971). Next, there was a small role in the thriller Blade (1973); then he played Casca in Julius Caesar (1979) and the title role in Coriolanus (1979). Regular work was coming in for the talented Freeman and he appeared in the prison dramas Attica: A Rebeli\u00e3o Sangrenta (1980) and Brubaker (1980), Testemunha Fatal (1981), and portrayed the final 24 hours of slain Malcolm X in Death of a Prophet (1981). For most of the 1980s, Freeman continued to contribute decent enough performances in films that fluctuated in their quality. However, he really stood out, scoring an Oscar nomination as a merciless hoodlum in Malandros de Rua (1987) and, then, he dazzled audiences and pulled a second Oscar nomination in the film version of Conduzindo Miss Daisy (1989) opposite Jessica Tandy. The same year, Freeman teamed up with youthful Matthew Broderick and fiery Denzel Washington in the epic Civil War drama Tempo de Gl\u00f3ria (1989) about freed slaves being recruited to form the first all-African American fighting brigade.His star continued to rise, and the 1990s kicked off strongly with roles in A Fogueira das Vaidades (1990), Robin Hood, o Pr\u00edncipe dos Ladr\u00f5es (1991), and O Poder de um Jovem (1992). Freeman's next role was as gunman Ned Logan, wooed out of retirement by friend William Munny to avenge several prostitutes in the wild west town of Big Whiskey in Clint Eastwood's de-mythologized western Os Imperdo\u00e1veis (1992). The film was a sh and scored an acting Oscar for Gene Hackman, a directing Oscar for Eastwood, and the Oscar for best picture. In 1993, Freeman made his directorial debut on Bopha! \u00c0 Flor da Pele (1993) and soon after formed his production company, Revelations Entertainment.More strong scripts came in, and Freeman was back behind bars depicting a knowledgeable inmate (and obtaining his third Oscar nomination), befriending falsely accused banker Tim Robbins in Um Sonho de Liberdade (1994). He was then back out hunting a religious serial killer in Seven: Os Sete Crimes Capitais (1995), starred alongside Keanu Reeves in Rea\u00e7\u00e3o em Cadeia (1996), and was pursuing another serial murderer in Beijos que Matam (1997).Further praise followed for his role in the slave tale of Amistad (1997), he was a worried US President facing Armageddon from above in Impacto Profundo (1998), appeared in Neil LaBute's black comedy A Enfermeira Betty (2000), and reprised his role as Alex Cross in Na Teia da Aranha (2001). Now highly popular, he was much in demand with cinema audiences, and he co-starred in the terrorist drama A Soma de Todos os Medos (2002), was a military officer in the Stephen King-inspired O Apanhador de Sonhos (2003), gave divine guidance as God to Jim Carrey in Todo Poderoso (2003), and played a minor role in the comedy O Golpe (2004).2005 was a huge year for Freeman. First, he he teamed up with good friend Clint Eastwood to appear in the drama, Menina de Ouro (2004). Freeman's on-screen performance is simply world-class as ex-prize fighter Eddie \"Scrap Iron\" Dupris, who works in a run-down boxing gym alongside grizzled trainer Frankie Dunn, as the two work together to hone the skills of never-say-die female boxer Hilary Swank. Freeman received his fourth Oscar nomination and, finally, impressed the Academy's judges enough to win the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance. He also narrated Steven Spielberg's Guerra dos Mundos (2005) and appeared in Batman Begins (2005) as Lucius Fox, a valuable ally of Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne/Batman for director Christopher Nolan. Freeman would reprise his role in the two sequels of the record-breaking, genre-redefining trilogy.Roles in tentpoles and indies followed; highlights include his role as a crime boss in Xeque-Mate (2006), a second go-round as God in A Volta do Todo Poderoso (2007) with Steve Carell taking over for Jim Carrey, and a supporting role in Ben Affleck's directorial debut, Medo da Verdade (2007). He co-starred with Jack Nicholson in the breakout hit Antes de Partir (2007) in 2007, and followed that up with another box-office success, O Procurado (2008), then segued into the second Batman film, Batman: O Cavaleiro das Trevas (2008).In 2009, he reunited with Eastwood to star in the director's true-life drama Invictus (2009), on which Freeman also served as an executive producer. For his portrayal of Nelson Mandela in the film, Freeman garnered Oscar, Golden Globe and Critics' Choice Award nominations, and won the National Board of Review Award for Best Actor.Recently, Freeman appeared in RED: Aposentados e Perigosos (2010), a surprise box-office hit; he narrated the Conan, o B\u00e1rbaro (2011) remake, starred in Rob Reiner's O Reencontro (2012); and capped the Batman trilogy with Batman: O Cavaleiro das Trevas Ressurge (2012). Freeman has several films upcoming, including the thriller Truque de Mestre (2013), under the direction of Louis Leterrier, and the science fiction actioner Oblivion (2013), in which he stars with Tom Cruise.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            firehouse44@hotmail.com\n          \n\n", "realName": null, "height": "188"},

Unlike Olivier, who preferred the stage to the screen, Brando concentrated his talents on movies after bidding the Broadway stage adieu in 1949, a decision for which he was severely criticized when his star began to dim in the 1960s and he was excoriated for squandering his talents. No actor ever exerted such a profound influence on succeeding generations of actors as did Brando. More than 50 years after he first scorched the screen as Stanley Kowalski in the movie version of Tennessee Williams' Uma Rua Chamada Pecado (1951) and a quarter-century after his last great performance as Col. Kurtz in Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now (1979), all American actors are still being measured by the yardstick that was Brando. It was if the shadow of John Barrymore, the great American actor closest to Brando in terms of talent and stardom, dominated the acting field up until the 1970s. He did not, nor did any other actor so dominate the public's consciousness of what WAS an actor before or since Brando's 1951 on-screen portrayal of Stanley made him a cultural icon. Brando eclipsed the reputation of other great actors circa 1950, such as Paul Muni and Fredric March. Only the luster of Spencer Tracy's reputation hasn't dimmed when seen in the starlight thrown off by Brando. However, neither Tracy nor Olivier created an entire school of acting just by the force of his personality. Brando did.Marlon Brando, Jr. was born on April 3, 1924, in Omaha, Nebraska, to Marlon Brando, Sr., a calcium carbonate salesman, and his artistically inclined wife, the former Dorothy Julia Pennebaker. \"Bud\" Brando was one of three children. His ancestry included English, Irish, German, Dutch, French Huguenot, Welsh, and Scottish; his surname originated with a distant German immigrant ancestor named \"Brandau.\" His oldest sister Jocelyn Brando was also an actress, taking after their mother, who engaged in amateur theatricals and mentored a then-unknown Henry Fonda, another Nebraska native, in her role as director of the Omaha Community Playhouse. Frannie, Brando's other sibling, was a visual artist. Both Brando sisters contrived to leave the Midwest for New York City, Jocelyn to study acting and Frannie to study art. Marlon managed to escape the vocational doldrums forecast for him by his cold, distant father and his disapproving schoolteachers by striking out for The Big Apple in 1943, following Jocelyn into the acting profession. Acting was the only thing he was good at, for which he received praise, so he was determined to make it his career - a high-school dropout, he had nothing else to fall back on, having been rejected by the military due to a knee injury he incurred playing football at Shattuck Military Academy, Brando Sr.'s alma mater. The school booted Marlon out as incorrigible before graduation.Acting was a skill he honed as a child, the lonely son of alcoholic parents. With his father away on the road, and his mother frequently intoxicated to the point of stupefaction, the young Bud would play-act for her to draw her out of her stupor and to attract her attention and love. His mother was exceedingly neglectful, but he loved her, particularly for instilling in him a love of nature, a feeling which informed his character Paul in \u00daltimo Tango em Paris (1972) (\"Last Tango in Paris\") when he is recalling his childhood for his young lover Jeanne. \"I don't have many good memories,\" Paul confesses, and neither did Brando of his childhood. Sometimes he had to go down to the town jail to pick up his mother after she had spent the night in the drunk tank and bring her home, events that traumatized the young boy but may have been the grain that irritated the oyster of his talent, producing the pearls of his performances. Anthony Quinn, his Oscar-winning co-star in Viva Zapata! (1952) told Brando's first wife Anna Kashfi, \"I admire Marlon's talent, but I don't envy the pain that created it.\"Brando enrolled in Erwin Piscator's Dramatic Workshop at New York's New School, and was mentored by Stella Adler, a member of a famous Yiddish Theatre acting family. Adler helped introduce to the New York stage the \"emotional memory\" technique of Russian theatrical actor, director and impresario Konstantin Stanislavski, whose motto was \"Think of your own experiences and use them truthfully.\" The results of this meeting between an actor and the teacher preparing him for a life in the theater would mark a watershed in American acting and culture.Brando made his debut on the boards of Broadway on October 19, 1944, in \"I Remember Mama,\" a great success. As a young Broadway actor, Brando was invited by talent scouts from several different studios to screen-test for them, but he turned them down because he would not let himself be bound by the then-standard seven-year contract. Brando would make his film debut quite some time later in Fred Zinnemann's Esp\u00edritos Ind\u00f4mitos (1950) for producer Stanley Kramer. Playing a paraplegic soldier, Brando brought new levels of realism to the screen, expanding on the verisimilitude brought to movies by Group Theatre alumni John Garfield, the predecessor closest to him in the raw power he projected on-screen. Ironically, it was Garfield whom producer Irene Mayer Selznick had chosen to play the lead in a new Tennessee Williams play she was about to produce, but negotiations broke down when Garfield demanded an ownership stake in \"A Streetcar Named Desire.\" Burt Lancaster was next approached, but couldn't get out of a prior film commitment. Then director Elia Kazan suggested Brando, whom he had directed to great effect in Maxwell Anderson's play \"Truckline Caf\u00e9,\" in which Brando co-starred with Karl Malden, who was to remain a close friend for the next 60 years.During the production of \"Truckline Caf\u00e9,\" Kazan had found that Brando's presence was so magnetic, he had to re-block the play to keep Marlon near other major characters' stage business, as the audience could not take its eyes off of him. For the scene where Brando's character re-enters the stage after killing his wife, Kazan placed him upstage-center, partially obscured by scenery, but where the audience could still see him as Karl Malden and others played out their scene within the caf\u00e9 set. When he eventually entered the scene, crying, the effect was electric. A young Pauline Kael, arriving late to the play, had to avert her eyes when Brando made this entrance as she believed the young actor on stage was having a real-life conniption. She did not look back until her escort commented that the young man was a great actor.The problem with casting Brando as Stanley was that he was much younger than the character as written by Williams. However, after a meeting between Brando and Williams, the playwright eagerly agreed that Brando would make an ideal Stanley. Williams believed that by casting a younger actor, the Neanderthalish Kowalski would evolve from being a vicious older man to someone whose unintentional cruelty can be attributed to his youthful ignorance. Brando ultimately was dissatisfied with his performance, though, saying he never was able to bring out the humor of the character, which was ironic as his characterization often drew laughs from the audience at the expense of Jessica Tandy's Blanche Dubois. During the out-of-town tryouts, Kazan realized that Brando's magnetism was attracting attention and audience sympathy away from Blanche to Stanley, which was not what the playwright intended. The audience's sympathy should be solely with Blanche, but many spectators were identifying with Stanley. Kazan queried Williams on the matter, broaching the idea of a slight rewrite to tip the scales back to more of a balance between Stanley and Blanche, but Williams demurred, smitten as he was by Brando, just like the preview audiences.For his part, Brando believed that the audience sided with his Stanley because Jessica Tandy was too shrill. He thought Vivien Leigh, who played the part in the movie, was ideal, as she was not only a great beauty but she WAS Blanche Dubois, troubled as she was in her real life by mental illness and nymphomania. Brando's appearance as Stanley on stage and on screen revolutionized American acting by introducing \"The Method\" into American consciousness and culture. Method acting, rooted in Adler's study at the Moscow Art Theatre of Stanislavsky's theories that she subsequently introduced to the Group Theatre, was a more naturalistic style of performing, as it engendered a close identification of the actor with the character's emotions. Adler took first place among Brando's acting teachers, and socially she helped turn him from an unsophisticated Midwestern farm boy into a knowledgeable and cosmopolitan artist who one day would socialize with presidents.Brando didn't like the term \"The Method,\" which quickly became the prominent paradigm taught by such acting gurus as Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio. Brando denounced Strasberg in his autobiography \"Songs My Mother Taught Me\" (1994), saying that he was a talentless exploiter who claimed he had been Brando's mentor. The Actors Studio had been founded by Strasberg along with Kazan and Stella Adler's husband, Harold Clurman, all Group Theatre alumni, all political progressives deeply committed to the didactic function of the stage. Brando credits his knowledge of the craft to Adler and Kazan, while Kazan in his autobiography \"A Life\" claimed that Brando's genius thrived due to the thorough training Adler had given him. Adler's method emphasized that authenticity in acting is achieved by drawing on inner reality to expose deep emotional experienceInterestingly, Elia Kazan believed that Brando had ruined two generations of actors, his contemporaries and those who came after him, all wanting to emulate the great Brando by employing The Method. Kazan felt that Brando was never a Method actor, that he had been highly trained by Adler and did not rely on gut instincts for his performances, as was commonly believed. Many a young actor, mistaken about the true roots of Brando's genius, thought that all it took was to find a character's motivation, empathize with the character through sense and memory association, and regurgitate it all on stage to become the character. That's not how the superbly trained Brando did it; he could, for example, play accents, whereas your average American Method actor could not. There was a method to Brando's art, Kazan felt, but it was not The Method.After Uma Rua Chamada Pecado (1951), for which he received the first of his eight Academy Award nominations, Brando appeared in a string of Academy Award-nominated performances - in Viva Zapata! (1952), J\u00falio C\u00e9sar (1953) and the summit of his early career, Kazan's Sindicato de Ladr\u00f5es (1954). For his \"Waterfront\" portrayal of meat-headed longshoreman Terry Malloy, the washed-up pug who \"coulda been a contender,\" Brando won his first Oscar. Along with his iconic performance as the rebel-without-a-cause Johnny in O Selvagem (1953) (\"What are you rebelling against?\" Johnny is asked. \"What have ya got?\" is his reply), the first wave of his career was, according to Jon Voight, unprecedented in its audacious presentation of such a wide range of great acting. Director John Huston said his performance of Marc Antony was like seeing the door of a furnace opened in a dark room, and co-star John Gielgud, the premier Shakespearean actor of the 20th century, invited Brando to join his repertory company.It was this period of 1951-54 that revolutionized American acting, spawning such imitators as James Dean - who modeled his acting and even his lifestyle on his hero Brando - the young Paul Newman and Steve McQueen. After Brando, every up-and-coming star with true acting talent and a brooding, alienated quality would be hailed as the \"New Brando,\" such as Warren Beatty in Kazan's Clamor do Sexo (1961). \"We are all Brando's children,\" Jack Nicholson pointed out in 1972. \"He gave us our freedom.\" He was truly \"The Godfather\" of American acting - and he was just 30 years old. Though he had a couple of failures, like D\u00e9sir\u00e9e, o Amor de Napole\u00e3o (1954) and Casa de Ch\u00e1 do Luar de Agosto (1956), he was clearly miscast in them and hadn't sought out the parts so largely escaped blame.In the second period of his career, 1955-62, Brando managed to uniquely establish himself as a great actor who also was a Top 10 movie star, although that star began to dim after the box-office high point of his early career, Sayonara (1957) (for which he received his fifth Best Actor Oscar nomination). Brando tried his hand at directing a film, the well-reviewed A Face Oculta (1961) that he made for his own production company, Pennebaker Productions (after his mother's maiden name). Stanley Kubrick had been hired to direct the film, but after months of script rewrites in which Brando participated, Kubrick and Brando had a falling out and Kubrick was sacked. According to his widow Christiane Kubrick, Stanley believed that Brando had wanted to direct the film himself all along.Tales proliferated about the profligacy of Brando the director, burning up a million and a half feet of expensive VistaVision film at 50 cents a foot, fully ten times the normal amount of raw stock expended during production of an equivalent motion picture. Brando took so long editing the film that he was never able to present the studio with a cut. Paramount took it away from him and tacked on a re-shot ending that Brando was dissatisfied with, as it made the Oedipal figure of Dad Longworth into a villain. In any normal film Dad would have been the heavy, but Brando believed that no one was innately evil, that it was a matter of an individual responding to, and being molded by, one's environment. It was not a black-and-white world, Brando felt, but a gray world in which once-decent people could do horrible things. This attitude explains his sympathetic portrayal of Nazi officer Christian Diestl in the film he made before shooting A Face Oculta (1961), Edward Dmytryk's filming of Irwin Shaw's novel Os Deuses Vencidos (1958). Shaw denounced Brando's performance, but audiences obviously disagreed, as the film was a major hit. It would be the last hit movie Brando would have for more than a decade.A Face Oculta (1961) generated respectable numbers at the box office, but the production costs were exorbitant - a then-staggering $6 million - which made it run a deficit. A film essentially is \"made\" in the editing room, and Brando found cutting to be a terribly boring process, which was why the studio eventually took the film away from him. Despite his proved talent in handling actors and a large production, Brando never again directed another film, though he would claim that all actors essentially direct themselves during the shooting of a picture.Between the production and release of A Face Oculta (1961), Brando appeared in Sidney Lumet's film version of Tennessee Williams' play \"Orpheus Descending,\" Vidas em Fuga (1960) which teamed him with fellow Oscar winners Anna Magnani and Joanne Woodward. Following in Elizabeth Taylor's trailblazing footsteps, Brando became the second performer to receive a $1-million salary for a motion picture, so high were the expectations for this re-teaming of Kowalski and his creator (in 1961 critic Hollis Alpert had published a book \"Brando and the Shadow of Stanley Kowalski\"). Critics and audiences waiting for another incendiary display from Brando in a Williams work were disappointed when the renamed Vidas em Fuga (1960) finally released. Though Tennessee was hot, with movie versions of Gata em Teto de Zinco Quente (1958) and De Repente, no \u00daltimo Ver\u00e3o (1959) burning up the box office and receiving kudos from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences, Vidas em Fuga (1960) was a failure. This was followed by the so-so box-office reception of A Face Oculta (1961) in 1961 and then by a failure of a more monumental kind: O Grande Motim (1962), a remake of the famed 1935 film.Brando signed on to O Grande Motim (1962) after turning down the lead in the David Lean classic Lawrence da Ar\u00e1bia (1962) because he didn't want to spend a year in the desert riding around on a camel. He received another $1-million salary, plus $200,000 in overages as the shoot went overtime and over budget. During principal photography, highly respected director Carol Reed (an eventual Academy Award winner) was fired, and his replacement, two-time Oscar winner Lewis Milestone, was shunted aside by Brando as Marlon basically took over the direction of the film himself. The long shoot became so notorious that President John F. Kennedy asked director Billy Wilder at a cocktail party not \"when\" but \"if\" the \"Bounty\" shoot would ever be over. The MGM remake of one of its classic Golden Age films garnered a Best Picture Oscar nomination and was one of the top grossing films of 1962, yet failed to go into the black due to its Brobdingnagian budget estimated at $20 million, which is equivalent to $120 million when adjusted for inflation.Brando and Taylor, whose Cle\u00f3patra (1963) nearly bankrupted 20th Century-Fox due to its huge cost overruns (its final budget was more than twice that of Brando's O Grande Motim (1962)), were pilloried by the show business press for being the epitome of the pampered, self-indulgent stars who were ruining the industry. Seeking scapegoats, the Hollywood press conveniently ignored the financial pressures on the studios. The studios had been hurt by television and by the antitrust-mandated divestiture of their movie theater chains, causing a large outflow of production to Italy and other countries in the 1950s and 1960s in order to lower costs. The studio bosses, seeking to replicate such blockbuster hits as the remakes of Os Dez Mandamentos (1956) and Ben-Hur (1959), were the real culprits behind the losses generated by large-budgeted films that found it impossible to recoup their costs despite long lines at the box office.While Elizabeth Taylor, receiving the unwanted gift of reams of publicity from her adulterous romance with Cle\u00f3patra (1963) co-star Richard Burton, remained hot until the tanking of her own Tennessee Williams-renamed debacle O Homem que Veio de Longe (1968), Brando from 1963 until the end of the decade appeared in one box-office failure after another as he worked out a contract he had signed with Universal Pictures. The industry had grown tired of Brando and his idiosyncrasies, though he continued to be offered prestige projects up through 1968.Some of the films Brando made in the 1960s were noble failures, such as Quando Irm\u00e3os se Defrontam (1963), Sangue em Sonora (1966) and Os Pecados de Todos N\u00f3s (1967). For every \"Reflections,\" though, there seemed to be two or three outright debacles, such as Dois Farristas Irresist\u00edveis (1964), Morituri (1965), Ca\u00e7ada Humana (1966), A Condessa de Hong Kong (1967), Candy (1968), A Noite do Dia Seguinte (1969). By the time Brando began making the anti-colonialist picture Queimada (1969) in Colombia with Gillo Pontecorvo in the director's chair, he was box-office poison, despite having worked in the previous five years with such top directors as Arthur Penn, John Huston and the legendary Charles Chaplin, and with such top-drawer co-stars as David Niven, Yul Brynner, Sophia Loren and Taylor.The rap on Brando in the 1960s was that a great talent had ruined his potential to be America's answer to Laurence Olivier, as his friend William Redfield limned the dilemma in his book \"Letters from an Actor\" (1967), a memoir about Redfield's appearance in Burton's 1964 theatrical production of \"Hamlet.\" By failing to go back on stage and recharge his artistic batteries, something British actors such as Burton were not afraid to do, Brando had stifled his great talent, by refusing to tackle the classical repertoire and contemporary drama. Actors and critics had yearned for an American response to the high-acting style of the Brits, and while Method actors such as Rod Steiger tried to create an American style, they were hampered in their quest, as their king was lost in a wasteland of Hollywood movies that were beneath his talent. Many of his early supporters now turned on him, claiming he was a crass sellout.Despite evidence in such films as Sangue em Sonora (1966) and Os Pecados de Todos N\u00f3s (1967) that Brando was in fact doing some of the best acting of his life, critics, perhaps with an eye on the box office, slammed him for failing to live up to, and nurture, his great gift. Brando's political activism, starting in the early 1960s with his championing of Native Americans' rights, followed by his participation in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference's March on Washington in 1963, and followed by his appearance at a Black Panther rally in 1968, did not win him many admirers in the establishment. In fact, there was a de facto embargo on Brando films in the recently segregated (officially, at least) southeastern US in the 1960s. Southern exhibitors simply would not book his films, and producers took notice. After 1968, Brando would not work for three years.Pauline Kael wrote of Brando that he was Fortune's fool. She drew a parallel with the latter career of John Barrymore, a similarly gifted thespian with talents as prodigious, who seemingly threw them away. Brando, like the late-career Barrymore, had become a great ham, evidenced by his turn as the faux Indian guru in the egregious Candy (1968), seemingly because the material was so beneath his talent. Most observers of Brando in the 1960s believed that he needed to be reunited with his old mentor Elia Kazan, a relationship that had soured due to Kazan's friendly testimony naming names before the notorious House un-American Activities Committee. Perhaps Brando believed this, too, as he originally accepted an offer to appear as the star of Kazan's film adaptation of his own novel, Movidos pelo \u00d3dio (1969). However, after the assassination of Martin Luther King, Brando backed out of the film, telling Kazan that he could not appear in a Hollywood film after this tragedy. Also reportedly turning down a role opposite box-office king Paul Newman in a surefire script, Butch Cassidy (1969), Brando decided to make Queimada (1969) with Pontecorvo. The film, a searing indictment of racism and colonialism, flopped at the box office but won the esteem of progressive critics and cultural arbiters such as Howard Zinn. He subsequently appeared in the British film Os que Chegam com a Noite (1971), a prequel to \"Turn of the Screw\" and another critical and box office failure.Kazan, after a life in film and the theater, said that, aside from Orson Welles, whose greatness lay in film making, he only met one actor who was a genius: Brando. Richard Burton, an intellectual with a keen eye for observation if not for his own film projects, said that he found Brando to be very bright, unlike the public perception of him as a Terry Malloy-type character that he himself inadvertently promoted through his boorish behavior. Brando's problem, Burton felt, was that he was unique, and that he had gotten too much fame too soon at too early an age. Cut off from being nurtured by normal contact with society, fame had distorted Brando's personality and his ability to cope with the world, as he had not had time to grow up outside the limelight.Truman Capote, who eviscerated Brando in print in the mid-'50s and had as much to do with the public perception of the dyslexic Brando as a dumbbell, always said that the best actors were ignorant, and that an intelligent person could not be a good actor. However, Brando was highly intelligent, and possessed of a rare genius in a then-deprecated art, acting. The problem that an intelligent performer has in movies is that it is the director, and not the actor, who has the power in his chosen field. Greatness in the other arts is defined by how much control the artist is able to exert over his chosen medium, but in movie acting, the medium is controlled by a person outside the individual artist. It is an axiom of the cinema that a performance, as is a film, is \"created\" in the cutting room, thus further removing the actor from control over his art. Brando had tried his hand at directing, in controlling the whole artistic enterprise, but he could not abide the cutting room, where a film and the film's performances are made. This lack of control over his art was the root of Brando's discontent with acting, with movies, and, eventually, with the whole wide world that invested so much cachet in movie actors, as long as \"they\" were at the top of the box-office charts. Hollywood was a matter of \"they\" and not the work, and Brando became disgusted.Charlton Heston, who participated in Martin Luther King's 1963 March on Washington with Brando, believes that Marlon was the great actor of his generation. However, noting a story that Brando had once refused a role in the early 1960s with the excuse \"How can I act when people are starving in India?,\" Heston believes that it was this attitude, the inability to separate one's idealism from one's work, that prevented Brando from reaching his potential. As Rod Steiger once said, Brando had it all, great stardom and a great talent. He could have taken his audience on a trip to the stars, but he simply would not. Steiger, one of Brando's children even though a contemporary, could not understand it. When James Mason' was asked in 1971 who was the best American actor, he had replied that since Brando had let his career go belly-up, it had to be George C. Scott, by default.Paramount thought that only Laurence Olivier would suffice, but Lord Olivier was ill. The young director believed there was only one actor who could play godfather to the group of Young Turk actors he had assembled for his film, The Godfather of method acting himself - Marlon Brando. Francis Ford Coppola won the fight for Brando, Brando won - and refused - his second Oscar, and Paramount won a pot of gold by producing the then top-grossing film of all-time, O Poderoso Chef\u00e3o (1972), a gangster movie most critics now judge one of the greatest American films of all time. Brando followed his iconic portrayal of Don Corleone with his Oscar-nominated turn in the high-grossing and highly scandalous \u00daltimo Tango em Paris (1972) (\"Last Tango in Paris\"), the first film dealing explicitly with sexuality in which an actor of Brando's stature had participated. He was now again a top ten box office star and once again heralded as the greatest actor of his generation, an unprecedented comeback that put him on the cover of \"Time\" magazine and would make him the highest-paid actor in the history of motion pictures by the end of the decade. Little did the world know that Brando, who had struggled through many projects in good faith during the 1960s, delivering some of his best acting, only to be excoriated and ignored as the films did not do well at the box office, essentially was through with the movies.After reaching the summit of his career, a rarefied atmosphere never reached before or since by any actor, Brando essentially walked away. He would give no more of himself after giving everything as he had done in \u00daltimo Tango em Paris (1972),\" a performance that embarrassed him, according to his autobiography. Brando had come as close to any actor to being the \"auteur,\" or author, of a film, as the English-language scenes of \"Tango\" were created by encouraging Brando to improvise. The improvisations were written down and turned into a shooting script, and the scripted improvisations were shot the next day. Pauline Kael, the Brando of movie critics in that she was the most influential arbiter of cinematic quality of her generation and spawned a whole legion of Kael wannabes, said Brando's performance in \u00daltimo Tango em Paris (1972) had revolutionized the art of film. Brando, who had to act to gain his mother's attention; Brando, who believed acting at best was nothing special as everyone in the world engaged in it every day of their lives to get what they wanted from other people; Brando, who believed acting at its worst was a childish charade and that movie stardom was a whorish fraud, would have agreed with Sam Peckinpah's summation of Pauline Kael: \"Pauline's a brilliant critic but sometimes she's just cracking walnuts with her ass.\" He probably would have done so in a simulacrum of those words, too.After another three-year hiatus, Brando took on just one more major role for the next 20 years, as the bounty hunter after Jack Nicholson in Arthur Penn's Duelo de Gigantes (1976), a western that succeeded neither with the critics or at the box office. Following The Godfather and Tango, Brando's performance was disappointing for some reviewers, who accused him of giving an erratic and inconsistent performance. In 1977, Brando made a rare appearance on television in the miniseries Roots: The Next Generations (1979), portraying George Lincoln Rockwell; he won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for his performance. In 1978, he narrated the English version of Raoni (1978), a French-Belgian documentary film directed by Jean-Pierre Dutilleux and Luiz Carlos Saldanha that focused on the life of Raoni Metuktire and issues surrounding the survival of the indigenous Indian tribes of north central Brazil.Later in his career, Brando concentrated on extracting the maximum amount of capital for the least amount of work from producers, as when he got the Salkind brothers to pony up a then-record $3.7 million against 10% of the gross for 13 days work on Superman: O Filme (1978). Factoring in inflation, the straight salary for \"Superman\" equals or exceeds the new record of $1 million a day Harrison Ford set with K-19: The Widowmaker (2002). He agreed to the role only on assurance that he would be paid a large sum for what amounted to a small part, that he would not have to read the script beforehand, and his lines would be displayed somewhere off-camera. Brando also filmed scenes for the movie's sequel, Superman II, but after producers refused to pay him the same percentage he received for the first movie, he denied them permission to use the footage.Before cashing his first paycheck for Superman: O Filme (1978), Brando had picked up $2 million for his extended cameo in Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now (1979) in a role, that of Col. Kurtz, that he authored on-camera through improvisation while Coppola shot take after take. It was Brando's last bravura star performance. He co-starred with George C. Scott and John Gielgud in A F\u00f3rmula (1980), but the film was another critical and financial failure. Years later though, he did receive an eighth and final Oscar nomination for his supporting role in Assassinato Sob Cust\u00f3dia (1989) after coming out of a near-decade-long retirement. Contrary to those who claimed he now only was in it for the money, Brando donated his entire seven-figure salary to an anti-apartheid charity. He then did an amusing performance in the comedy Um Novato na M\u00e1fia (1990), winning rave reviews. He portrayed Tomas de Torquemada in the historical drama 1492: A Conquista do Para\u00edso (1992), but his performance was denounced and the film was another box office failure. He made another comeback in the Johnny Depp romantic drama Don Juan DeMarco (1994), which co-starred Faye Dunaway as his wife. He then appeared in A Ilha do Dr. Moreau (1996), co-starring Val Kilmer, who he didn't get along with. The filming was an unpleasant experience for Brando, as well as another critical and box office failure.Brando had first attracted media attention at the age of 24, when \"Life\" magazine ran a photo of himself and his sister Jocelyn, who were both then appearing on Broadway. The curiosity continued, and snowballed. Playing the paraplegic soldier of Esp\u00edritos Ind\u00f4mitos (1950), Brando had gone to live at a Veterans Administration hospital with actual disabled veterans, and confined himself to a wheelchair for weeks. It was an acting method, research, that no one in Hollywood had ever heard of before, and that willingness to experience life.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Jon C.

They divorced when he was young. His mother moved them into his grandparents' home in the South Bronx. Pacino found himself often repeating the plots and voices of characters he had seen in the movies. Bored and unmotivated in school, he found a haven in school plays, and his interest soon blossomed into a full-time career. Starting onstage, he went through a period of depression and poverty, sometimes having to borrow bus fare to succeed to auditions. He made it into the prestigious Actors Studio in 1966, studying under Lee Strasberg, creator of the Method Approach that would become the trademark of many 1970s-era actors.After appearing in a string of plays in supporting roles, Pacino finally attained success off-Broadway with Israel Horovitz's \"The Indian Wants the Bronx\", winning an Obie Award for the 1966-67 season. That was followed by a Tony Award for \"Does the Tiger Wear a Necktie?\" His first feature films made little departure from the gritty realistic stage performances that earned him respect: he played a drug addict in Os Viciados (1971) after his film debut in Uma Garota Avan\u00e7ada (1969). The role of Michael Corleone in O Poderoso Chef\u00e3o (1972) was one of the most sought-after of the time: Robert Redford, Warren Beatty, Jack Nicholson, Ryan O'Neal, Robert De Niro and a host of other actors either wanted it or were mentioned, but director Francis Ford Coppola wanted Pacino for the role.Coppola was successful but Pacino was reportedly in constant fear of being fired during the very difficult shoot. The film was a monster hit that earned Pacino his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. However, instead of taking on easier projects for the big money he could now command, Pacino threw his support behind what he considered tough but important films, such as the true-life crime drama Serpico (1973) and the tragic real-life bank robbery film Um Dia de C\u00e3o (1975). He was nominated three consecutive years for the \"Best Actor\" Academy Award. He faltered slightly with Um Momento, Uma Vida (1977), but regained his stride with Justi\u00e7a para Todos (1979), for which he received another Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. Unfortunately, this would signal the beginning of a decline in his career, which produced flops like Parceiros da Noite (1980) and Autor em Fam\u00edlia (1982).Pacino took on another vicious gangster role and cemented his legendary status in the ultra-violent cult film Scarface (1983), but a monumental mistake was about to follow. A Revolu\u00e7\u00e3o (1985) endured an endless and seemingly cursed shoot in which equipment was destroyed, weather was terrible, and Pacino fell ill with pneumonia. Constant changes in the script further derailed the project. The Revolutionary War-themed film, considered among the worst films ever made, resulted in awful reviews and kept him off the screen for the next four years. Returning to the stage, Pacino did much to give back and contribute to the theatre, which he considers his first love. He directed a film, The Local Stigmatic (1990), but it remains unreleased. He lifted his self-imposed exile with the striking V\u00edtimas de uma Paix\u00e3o (1989) as a hard-drinking policeman. This marked the second phase of Pacino's career, being the first to feature his now famous dark, owl eyes and hoarse, gravelly voice.Returning to the Corleones, Pacino made O Poderoso Chef\u00e3o III (1990) and earned raves for his first comedic role in the colorful adaptation Dick Tracy (1990). This earned him another Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor, and two years later he was nominated for O Sucesso a Qualquer Pre\u00e7o (1992). He went into romantic mode for Frankie & Johnny (1991). In 1992, he finally won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his amazing performance in Perfume de Mulher (1992). A mixture of technical perfection (he plays a blind man) and charisma, the role was tailor-made for him, and remains a classic.The next few years would see Pacino becoming more comfortable with acting and movies as a business, turning out great roles in great films with more frequency and less of the demanding personal involvement of his wilder days. O Pagamento Final (1993) proved another gangster classic, as did the epic crime drama Fogo Contra Fogo (1995) directed by Michael Mann and co-starring Robert De Niro. He directed the film adaptation of Shakespeare's Ricardo III - Um Ensaio (1996). During this period, City Hall: Conspira\u00e7\u00e3o no Alto Escal\u00e3o (1996), Donnie Brasco (1997) and Advogado do Diabo (1997) all came out. Reteaming with Mann and then Oliver Stone, he gave commanding performances in O Informante (1999) and Um Domingo Qualquer (1999).In the 2000s, Pacino starred in a number of theatrical blockbusters, including Treze Homens e um Novo Segredo (2007), but his choice in television roles (the vicious, closeted Roy Cohn in the HBO miniseries Anjos na Am\u00e9rica (2003) and his sensitive portrayal of Jack Kevorkian, in the television movie Voc\u00ea n\u00e3o Conhece o Jack (2010)) are reminiscent of the bolder choices of his early career. Each television project garnered him an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie.Never wed, Pacino has a daughter, Julie Marie, with acting teacher Jan Tarrant, and a set of twins with former longtime girlfriend Beverly D'Angelo. His romantic history includes Jill Clayburgh, Veruschka von Lehndorff, Carole Mallory, Debra Winger, Tuesday Weld, Marthe Keller, Carmen Cervera, Kathleen Quinlan, Lyndall Hobbs, Penelope Ann Miller, and a two-decade intermittent relationship with \"Godfather\" co-star Diane Keaton. He currently lives with Argentinian actress Lucila Sol\u00e1, who is 36 years his junior.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Pedro Borges\n          \n\n", "realName": "Alfredo James Pacino", "height": "170"},

His father was a meat dealer and butcher. The athletically gifted Caan played football at Michigan State University while studying economics, holds a black belt in karate and for several years was even a regular on the rodeo circuit, where he was nicknamed \"The Jewish Cowboy\". However, while studying at Hofstra University, he became intrigued by acting and was interviewed and accepted at Sanford Meisner's Neighborhood Playhouse. He then won a scholarship to study under acting coach Wynn Handman and began to appear in several off-Broadway productions, including \"I Roam\" and \"Mandingo\".He made his screen debut as a sailor in Irma la Douce (1963) and began to impress audiences with his work in Faixa Vermelha 7000 (1965) and the western El Dorado (1967) alongside John Wayne and Robert Mitchum. Further work followed in Seis N\u00e3o Regressaram (1968) and in the sensitive Caminhos Mal Tra\u00e7ados (1969). However, audiences were moved to tears as he put in a heart-rending performance as cancer-stricken Chicago Bears running back Brian Piccolo in the highly rated made-for-TV film Gl\u00f3ria e Derrota (1971).With these strong performances under his belt, Francis Ford Coppola then cast him as hot-tempered gangster Santino \"Sonny\" Corleone in the Mafia epic O Poderoso Chef\u00e3o (1972). The film was an enormous success, Caan scored a Best Supporting Actor nomination and, in the years since, the role has proven to be the one most fondly remembered by his legion of fans. He reprised the role for several flashback scenes in the sequel O Poderoso Chef\u00e3o II (1974) and then moved on to several very diverse projects. These included a cop-buddy crime partnership with Alan Arkin in the uneven Duas Ovelhas Negras (1974), a superb performance as a man playing for his life in O Jogador (1974) alongside Lauren Hutton, and pairing with Barbra Streisand in Funny Lady (1975). Two further strong lead roles came up for him in 1975, first as futuristic sports star \"Jonathon E\" questioning the moral fiber of a sterile society in Rollerball: Os Gladiadores do Futuro (1975) and teaming up with Robert Duvall in the Sam Peckinpah spy thriller Elite de Assassinos (1975).Unfortunately, Caan's rising star sputtered badly at this stage of his career, and several film projects failed to find fire with either critics or audiences. These included such failures as the hokey Dois Vigaristas em Nova York (1976), the quasi-western Ra\u00edzes da Ambi\u00e7\u00e3o (1978) and the saccharine Cap\u00edtulo Dois: Em Busca da Felicidade (1979). However, he did score again with the stylish Michael Mann-directed heist movie Profiss\u00e3o: Ladr\u00e3o (1981). He followed this with a supernatural romantic comedy titled Meu Ador\u00e1vel Fantasma (1982) and then, due to personal conflicts, dropped out of the spotlight for several years before returning with a stellar performance under old friend Francis Ford Coppola in the moving Jardins de Pedra (1987).Caan appeared back in favor with fans and critics alike and raised his visibility with the sci-fi hit Miss\u00e3o Alien (1988) and Dick Tracy (1990), then surprised everyone by playing a meek romance novelist held captive after a car accident by a deranged fan in the dynamic Louca Obsess\u00e3o (1990). The 1990s were kind to him and he notched up roles as a band leader in Para Eles, com Muito Amor (1991), another gangster in Lua de Mel a Tr\u00eas (1992), appeared in the indie hit Pura Adrenalina (1996) and pursued Arnold Schwarzenegger in Queima de Arquivo (1996).The demand on Caan's talents seems to have increased steadily over the past few years as he is making himself known to a new generation of fans. Recent hot onscreen roles have included Caminho sem Volta (2000), Cidade Fantasma (2002) and Dogville (2003). In addition, he finds himself at the helm of the hit TV series Las Vegas (2003) as casino security chief \"Big Ed\" Deline. An actor of undeniably manly appeal, James Caan continues to surprise and delight audiences with his invigorating performances.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            firehouse44\n          \n\n", "realName": "James Edmund Caan", "height": "176"},

She studied Drama at Santa Ana College, before dropping out in favor of the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York. After appearing in summer stock for several months, she got her first major stage role in the Broadway rock musical \"Hair\". As understudy to the lead, she gained attention by not removing any of her clothing. In 1968, Woody Allen cast her in his Broadway play \"Play It Again, Sam,\" which had a successful run. It was during this time that she became involved with Allen and appeared in a number of his films. The first one was Sonhos de um Sedutor (1972), the screen adaptation of the stage play. That same year Francis Ford Coppola cast her as Kay in the Oscar-winning O Poderoso Chef\u00e3o (1972), and she was on her way to stardom. She reprized that role in the film's first sequel, O Poderoso Chef\u00e3o II (1974). She then appeared with Allen again in O Dorminhoco (1973) and A \u00daltima Noite de B\u00f3ris Grushenko (1975).In 1977, she broke away from her comedy image to appear in the chilling \u00c0 Procura de Mr. Goodbar (1977), which won her a Golden Globe nomination. It was the same year that she appeared in what many regard as her best performance, in the title role of Noivo Neur\u00f3tico, Noiva Nervosa (1977), which Allen wrote specifically for her (her real last name is Hall, and her nickname is Annie), and what an impact she made. She won the Oscar and the British Award for Best Actress, and Allen won the Directors Award from the DGA. She started a fashion trend with her unisex clothes and was the poster girl for a lot of young males. Her mannerisms and awkward speech became almost a national craze. The question being asked, though, was, \"Is she just a lightweight playing herself, or is there more depth to her personality?\" For whatever reason, she appeared in but one film a year for the next two years and those films were by Allen. When they broke up she was next involved with Warren Beatty and appeared in his film Reds (1981), as the bohemian female journalist Louise Bryant. For her performance, she received nominations for the Academy Award and the Golden Globe. For the rest of the 1980s she appeared infrequently in films but won nominations in three of them. Attempting to break the typecasting she had fallen into, she took on the role of a confused, somewhat naive woman who becomes involved with Middle Eastern terrorists in A Garota do Tambor (1984). To offset her lack of movie work, Diane began directing. She directed the documentary Heaven (1987), as well as some music videos. For television she directed an episode of the popular, but strange, Twin Peaks (1990).In the 1990s, she began to get more mature roles, though she reprized the role of Kay Corleone in the third \"Godfather\" epic, O Poderoso Chef\u00e3o III (1990).

His father, Carmine Coppola, was a composer and musician. His mother, Italia Coppola (n\u00e9e Pennino), had been an actress. Francis Ford Coppola graduated with a degree in drama from Hofstra University, and did graduate work at UCLA in filmmaking. He was training as assistant with filmmaker Roger Corman, working in such capacities as sound-man, dialogue director, associate producer and, eventually, director of Dem\u00eancia 13 (1963), Coppola's first feature film. During the next four years, Coppola was involved in a variety of script collaborations, including writing an adaptation of \"This Property is Condemned\" by Tennessee Williams (with Fred Coe and Edith Sommer), and screenplays for Paris Est\u00e1 em Chamas? (1966) and Patton, Rebelde ou Her\u00f3i? (1970), the film for which Coppola won a Best Original Screenplay Academy Award. In 1966, Coppola's 2nd film brought him critical acclaim and a Master of Fine Arts degree. In 1969, Coppola and George Lucas established American Zoetrope, an independent film production company based in San Francisco. The company's first project was THX 1138 (1971), produced by Coppola and directed by Lucas. Coppola also produced the second film that Lucas directed, Loucuras de Ver\u00e3o (1973), in 1973. This movie got five Academy Award nominations, including one for Best Picture. In 1971, Coppola's film O Poderoso Chef\u00e3o (1972) became one of the highest-grossing movies in history and brought him an Oscar for writing the screenplay with Mario Puzo The film was a Best Picture Academy Award-winner, and also brought Coppola a Best Director Oscar nomination. Following his work on the screenplay for O Grande Gatsby (1974), Coppola's next film was A Conversa\u00e7\u00e3o (1974), which was honored with the Golden Palm Award at the Cannes Film Festival, and brought Coppola Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay Oscar nominations. Also released that year, O Poderoso Chef\u00e3o II (1974), rivaled the success of O Poderoso Chef\u00e3o (1972), and won six Academy Awards, bringing Coppola Oscars as a producer, director and writer. Coppola then began work on his most ambitious film, Apocalypse Now (1979), a Vietnam War epic that was inspired by Joseph Conrad's A Maldi\u00e7\u00e3o da Selva (1993). Released in 1979, the acclaimed film won a Golden Palm Award at the Cannes Film Festival, and two Academy Awards. Also that year, Coppola executive produced the hit O Corcel Negro (1979). With George Lucas, Coppola executive produced Kagemusha, a Sombra de um Samurai (1980), directed by Akira Kurosawa, and Mishima: Uma Vida em Quatro Tempos (1985), directed by Paul Schrader and based on the life and writings of Yukio Mishima. Coppola also executive produced such films as O Pequeno M\u00e1gico (1982), Hammett - Mist\u00e9rio em Chinatown (1982) O Regresso do Corcel Negro (1983), Barfly: Condenados pelo V\u00edcio (1987), Wind (1992), O Jardim Secreto (1993), etc.He helped to make a star of his nephew, Nicolas Cage. Personal tragedy hit in 1986 when his son Gio died in a boating accident. Francis Ford Coppola is one of America's most erratic, energetic and controversial filmmakers.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Kornel Osvart <osvart@iname.com>\n          \n\n", "realName": null, "height": "179"},

Duvall majored in drama at Principia College (Elsah, IL), then served a two-year hitch in the army after graduating in 1953. He began attending The Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre In New York City on the G.I. Bill in 1955, studying under Sanford Meisner along with Dustin Hoffman, with whom Duvall shared an apartment. Both were close to another struggling young actor named Gene Hackman. Meisner cast Duvall in the play \"The Midnight Caller\" by Horton Foote, a link that would prove critical to his career, as it was Foote who recommended Duvall to play the mentally disabled \"Boo Radley\" in O Sol \u00e9 para Todos (1962). This was his first \"major\" role since his 1956 motion picture debut as an MP in Marcado pela Sarjeta (1956), starring Paul Newman.Duvall began making a name for himself as a stage actor in New York, winning an Obie Award in 1965 playing incest-minded longshoreman \"Eddie Carbone\" in the off-Broadway revival of Arthur Miller's \"A View from the Bridge\", a production for which his old roommate Hoffman was assistant director. He found steady work in episodic TV and appeared as a modestly billed character actor in films, such as Arthur Penn's Ca\u00e7ada Humana (1966) with Marlon Brando and in Robert Altman's No Assombroso Mundo da Lua (1967) and Francis Ford Coppola's Caminhos Mal Tra\u00e7ados (1969), in both of which he co-starred with James Caan.He was also memorable as the heavy who is shot by John Wayne at the climax of Bravura Ind\u00f4mita (1969) and was the first \"Maj. Frank Burns\", creating the character in Altman's Korean War comedy M.A.S.H. (1970). He also appeared as the eponymous lead in George Lucas' directorial debut, THX 1138 (1971). It was Francis Ford Coppola, casting O Poderoso Chef\u00e3o (1972), who reunited Duvall with Brando and Caan and provided him with his career breakthrough as mob lawyer \"Tom Hagen\". He received the first of his six Academy Award nominations for the role.Thereafter, Duvall had steady work in featured roles in such films as O Poderoso Chef\u00e3o II (1974), Elite de Assassinos (1975), Rede de Intrigas (1976), Vis\u00f5es de Sherlock Holmes (1976) and A \u00c1guia Pousou (1976). Occasionally this actor's actor got the chance to assay a lead role, most notably in Tomorrow (1972), in which he was brilliant as William Faulkner's inarticulate backwoods farmer. He was less impressive as the lead in Ruge o \u00d3dio (1973), in which he played a character based on real-life NYPD detective Eddie Egan, the same man his old friend Gene Hackman had won an Oscar for playing, in fictionalized form as \"Popeye Doyle\" in Opera\u00e7\u00e3o Fran\u00e7a (1971).It was his appearance as \"Lt. Col. Kilgore\" in another Coppola picture, Apocalypse Now (1979), that solidified Duvall's reputation as a great actor. He got his second Academy Award nomination for the role, and was named by the Guinness Book of World Records as the most versatile actor in the world. Duvall created one of the most memorable characters ever assayed on film, and gave the world the memorable phrase, \"I love the smell of napalm in the morning!\"Subsequently, Duvall proved one of the few established character actors to move from supporting to leading roles, with his Oscar-nominated turns in O Grande Santini - O Dom da F\u00faria (1979) and A For\u00e7a do Carinho (1983), the latter of which won him the Academy Award for Best Actor. Now at the summit of his career, Duvall seemed to be afflicted with the fabled \"Oscar curse\" that had overwhelmed the careers of fellow Academy Award winners Luise Rainer, Rod Steiger and Cliff Robertson. He could not find work equal to his talents, either due to his post-Oscar salary demands or a lack of perception in the industry that he truly was leading man material. He did not appear in O Poderoso Chef\u00e3o III (1990), as the studio would not give in to his demands for a salary commensurate with that of Al Pacino, who was receiving $5 million to reprise Michael Corleone.His greatest achievement in his immediate post-Oscar period was his triumphant characterization of grizzled Texas Ranger Gus McCrae in the TV mini-series Os Pistoleiros do Oeste (1989), for which he received an Emmy nomination. He received a second Emmy nomination and a Golden Globe for his portrayal of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin in Stalin (1992), and a third Emmy nomination playing Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann in The Man Who Captured Eichmann (1996).The shakeout of his career doldrums was that Duvall eventually settled back into his status as one of the premier character actors in the industry, rivaled only by his old friend Gene Hackman. Duvall, unlike Hackman, also has directed pictures, including the documentary We're Not the Jet Set (1977), Angelo My Love (1983) and O Tango e o Assassino (2002). As a writer-director, Duvall gave himself one of his most memorable roles, that of the preacher on the run from the law in O Ap\u00f3stolo (1997), a brilliant performance for which he received his third Best Actor nomination and fifth Oscar nomination overall. The film brought Duvall back to the front ranks of great actors, and was followed by a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nod for A Qualquer Pre\u00e7o (1998).Robert Duvall will long be remembered as one of the great naturalistic American screen actors in the mode of Spencer Tracy and his frequent co-star Marlon Brando. His performances as \"Boo Radley\" in O Sol \u00e9 para Todos (1962), \"Jackson Fentry\" in Tomorrow (1972), \"Tom Hagen\" in the first two \"Godfather\" movies, \"Frank Hackett\" in Rede de Intrigas (1976), \"Lt. Col. Kilgore\" in Apocalypse Now (1979), \"Bull Meechum\" in O Grande Santini - O Dom da F\u00faria (1979), \"Mac Sledge\" in A For\u00e7a do Carinho (1983), \"Gus McCrae\" in Os Pistoleiros do Oeste (1989) and \"Sonny Dewey\" in O Ap\u00f3stolo (1997) rank as some of the finest acting ever put on film.

His mother was a circus performer and his father, who was born in South Africa, was a commercial pilot. The family lived in different countries throughout Bale's childhood, including England, Portugal, and the United States. Bale acknowledges the constant change was one of the influences on his career choice.His first acting job was a cereal commercial in 1983; amazingly, the next year, he debuted on the West End stage in \"The Nerd\". A role in the 1986 NBC mini-series Anast\u00e1cia: O Mist\u00e9rio de Ana (1986) caught Steven Spielberg's eye, leading to Bale's well-documented role in Imp\u00e9rio do Sol (1987). For the range of emotions he displayed as the star of the war epic, he earned a special award by the National Board of Review for Best Performance by a Juvenile Actor.Adjusting to fame and his difficulties with attention (he thought about quitting acting early on), Bale appeared in Kenneth Branagh's 1989 adaptation of Shakespeare's Henrique V (1989) and starred as Jim Hawkins in a TV movie version of A Ilha do Tesouro (1990). Bale worked consistently through the 1990s, acting and singing in Extra! Extra! (1992), Os \u00daltimos Rebeldes (1993), Ador\u00e1veis Mulheres (1994), Retratos de uma Mulher (1996), O Agente Secreto (1996), Reflexos do Passado (1997), Velvet Goldmine (1998), All the Little Animals (1998), and Sonho de uma Noite de Ver\u00e3o (1999). Toward the end of the decade, with the rise of the Internet, Bale found himself becoming one of the most popular online celebrities around, though he, with a couple notable exceptions, maintained a private, tabloid-free mystique.Bale roared into the next decade with a lead role in Psicopata Americano (2000), director Mary Harron's adaptation of the controversial Bret Easton Ellis novel. In the film, Bale played a murderous Wall Street executive obsessed with his own physicality - a trait for which Bale would become a specialist. Subsequently, the 10th Anniversary issue for \"Entertainment Weekly\" crowned Bale one of the \"Top 8 Most Powerful Cult Figures\" of the past decade, citing his cult status on the Internet. EW also called Bale one of the \"Most Creative People in Entertainment\", and \"Premiere\" lauded him as one of the \"Hottest Leading Men Under 30\".Bale was truly on the Hollywood radar at this time, and he turned in a range of performances in the remake Shaft (2000), O Capit\u00e3o Corelli (2001), the balmy Laurel Canyon: A Rua das Tenta\u00e7\u00f5es (2002), and Reino de Fogo (2002), a dragons-and-magic commercial misfire that has its share of defenders.Two more cult films followed: Equilibrium (2002) and O Oper\u00e1rio (2004), the latter of which gained attention mainly due to Bale's physical transformation - he dropped a reported 60+ pounds for the role of a lathe operator with a secret that causes him to suffer from insomnia for over a year.Bale's abilities to transform his body and to disappear into a character influenced the decision to cast him in Batman Begins (2005), the first chapter in Christopher Nolan's definitive trilogy that proved a dark-themed narrative could resonate with audiences worldwide. The film also resurrected a character that had been shelved by Warner Bros. after a series of demising returns, capped off by the commercial and critical failure of Batman & Robin (1997). A quiet, personal victory for Bale: he accepted the role after the passing of his father in late 2003, an event that caused him to question whether he would continue performing.Bale segued into two indie features in the wake of Batman's phenomenal success: O Novo Mundo (2005) and Tempos de Viol\u00eancia (2005). He continued working with respected independent directors in 2006's O Sobrevivente (2006), Werner Herzog's feature version of his earlier, Emmy-nominated documentary, O Pequeno Dieter Precisa Voar (1997). Leading up to the second Batman film, Bale starred in O Grande Truque (2006), the remake of Os Indom\u00e1veis (2007), and a reunion with director Todd Haynes in the experimental Bob Dylan biography, N\u00e3o Estou L\u00e1 (2007).Anticipation for Batman: O Cavaleiro das Trevas (2008) was spun into unexpected heights with the tragic passing of Heath Ledger, whose performance as The Joker became the highlight of the sequel. Bale's graceful statements to the press reminded us of the days of the refined Hollywood star as the second installment exceeded the box-office performance of its predecessor.Bale's next role was the eyebrow-raising decision to take over the role of John Connor in the Schwarzenegger-less O Exterminador do Futuro: A Salva\u00e7\u00e3o (2009), followed by a turn as federal agent Melvin Purvis in Michael Mann's Inimigos P\u00fablicos (2009). Both films were hits but not the blockbusters they were expected to be.For all his acclaim and box-office triumphs, Bale would earn his first Oscar in 2011 in the wake of O Vencedor (2010)'s critical and commercial success. Bale earned the Best Supporting Actor award for his portrayal of Dicky Eklund, brother to and trainer of boxer \"Irish\" Micky Ward, played by Mark Wahlberg. Bale again showed his ability to reshape his body with another gaunt, skeletal transformation.Bale then turned to another auteur, Yimou Zhang, for the epic Flores do Oriente (2011), in which Bale portrayed a priest trapped in the midst of the Rape of Nanking. Bale earned headlines for his attempt to visit with Chinese civil-rights activist Chen Guangcheng, which was blocked by the Chinese government.Bale capped his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman in Batman: O Cavaleiro das Trevas Ressurge (2012); in the wake of the Aurora, Colorado tragedy, Bale made a quiet pilgrimage to the state to visit with survivors of the attack that left theatergoers dead and injured. He also starred in the thriller Tudo por Justi\u00e7a (2013) with Cora\u00e7\u00e3o Louco (2009) writer/director Scott Cooper, and the drama-comedy Trapa\u00e7a (2013), reuniting with David O. Russell.Bale will re-team with O Novo Mundo (2005) director Terrence Malick for two upcoming projects: Cavaleiro de Copas (2015) and an as-yet-untitled drama.In his personal life, he devotes time to charities including Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Foundation. He lives with his wife, Sibi Blazic, and their two children.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Anonymous\n          \n\n", "realName": "Christian Charles Philip Bale", "height": "183"},

He spent several years trying desperately to sway this image, but this was a double-edged sword. His work comprised nineteen films, including 10 Coisas que Eu Odeio em Voc\u00ea (1999), O Patriota (2000), Cora\u00e7\u00e3o de Cavaleiro (2001), A \u00daltima Ceia (2001), Ned Kelly (2003), Os Irm\u00e3os Grimm (2005), Os Reis de Dogtown (2005), O Segredo de Brokeback Mountain (2005), Casanova (2005), Candy (2006), N\u00e3o Estou L\u00e1 (2007), Batman: O Cavaleiro das Trevas (2008) and O Mundo Imagin\u00e1rio do Doutor Parnassus (2009). He also produced and directed music videos and aspired to be a film director.Heath Ledger was born on the fourth of April 1979, in Perth, Western Australia, to Sally (Ramshaw), a teacher of French, and Kim Ledger, a mining engineer who also raced cars. His ancestry was Scottish, English, Irish, and Sephardi Jewish. As the story goes, in junior high school it was compulsory to take one of two electives, either cooking or drama. As Heath could not see himself in a cooking class he tried his hand at drama. Heath was talented, however the rest of the class did not acknowledge his talent. When he was seventeen he and a friend decided to pack up, leave school, take a car and rough it to Sydney. Heath believed Sydney to be the place where dreams were made or, at least, where actors could possibly get their big break. Upon arriving in Sydney with a purported sixty-nine cents to his name, Heath tried everything to get a break.His first real acting job came in a low-budget movie called Assassinato Em Blackrock (1997), a largely unimpressive clich\u00e9; an adolescent angst film about one boy's struggle when he learns his best mate raped a girl. He only had a very small role in the film. After that small role Heath auditioned for a role in a T.V. show called Sweat (1996) about a group of young Olympic hopefuls. He was offered one of two roles, one as a swimmer, another as a gay cyclist. Heath accepted the latter because he felt to really stand out as an actor one had to accept unique roles that stood out from the bunch. It got him small notice, but unfortunately the show was quickly axed, forcing him to look for other roles. He was in Home and Away (1988) for a very short period, in which he played a surfer who falls in love with one of the girls of Summer Bay. Then came his very brief role in PC - Digitando Confus\u00f5es (1997), a film which existed solely to cash in on guitar prodigy Nathan Cavaleri's brief moment of fame, where he was the hottest thing in Australia. Heath played a student in the film, involved in a stage production of a Shakespeare play, in which he played \"Oberon\". A very brief role, this offered him a small paycheck but did nothing to advance his career. Then came Duas M\u00e3os (1999). He went to the U.S. trying to audition for film roles, showcasing his brief role in Roar (1997) opposite then unknown Vera Farmiga.Then Australian director Gregor Jordan auditioned him for the lead in Duas M\u00e3os (1999), which he got. An in your face Aussie crime thriller, Duas M\u00e3os (1999) was outstanding and helped him secure a role in 10 Coisas que Eu Odeio em Voc\u00ea (1999). After that, it seemed Heath was being typecast as a young hunk, which he did not like, so he accepted a role in a very serious war drama O Patriota (2000).What followed was a stark inconsistency of roles, Ledger accepting virtually every single character role, anything to avoid being typecast. Some met with praise, like his short role in A \u00daltima Ceia (2001), but his version of Ned Kelly (2003) was an absolute flop, which led distributors hesitant to even release it outside Australia. Heath finally had deserved success with his role in O Segredo de Brokeback Mountain (2005). For his portrayal of Ennis Del Mar in in the film, Ledger won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor and Best International Actor from the Australian Film Institute, and was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role and for the Academy Award for Best Actor.Ledger was found dead on January 22, 2008 in his apartment in the Manhattan neighborhood of SoHo, with a bottle of prescription sleeping pills near-by. It was concluded weeks later that he died of an accidental overdose of prescription drugs that included pain-killers, sleeping pills and anti-anxiety medication. His death occurred during editing of Batman: O Cavaleiro das Trevas (2008) and in the midst of filming his last role as Tony in O Mundo Imagin\u00e1rio do Doutor Parnassus (2009).Posthumously, he shared the 2007 Independent Spirit Robert Altman Award with the rest of the ensemble cast, the director, and the casting director for the film N\u00e3o Estou L\u00e1 (2007), which was inspired by the life and songs of American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan. In the film, Ledger portrayed a fictional actor named Robbie Clark, one of six characters embodying aspects of Dylan's life and persona.A few months before his death, Ledger had finished filming his performance as the Joker in 'Batman: O Cavaleiro das Trevas (2008). His untimely death cast a somber shadow over the subsequent promotion of the $185 million Batman production. Ledger received more than thirty posthumous accolades for his critically acclaimed performance as the Joker, the psychopathic clown prince of crime, in the film, including the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, a Best Actor International Award at the 2008 Australian Film Institute Awards (for which he is the second actor to win an acting award posthumously after Peter Finch who won an Oscar for Network (Best Actor 1977)), the 2008 Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actor, the 2009 Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture, and the 2009 BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            James Briggs and Pedro Borges\n          \n\n", "realName": "Heath Andrew Ledger", "height": "185"},

In the years that followed, he worked in more than 100 television dramas, with repertory companies throughout England and eventually in the stage hit \"The Long and the Short and the Tall\".Zulu (1964), the epic retelling of a historic 19th-century battle in South Africa between British soldiers and Zulu warriors, brought Caine to international attention. Instead of being typecast as a low-ranking Cockney soldier, he played a snobbish, aristocratic officer. Although \"Zulu\" was a major success, it was the role of Harry Palmer in Ipcress: Arquivo Confidencial (1965) and the title role in Como Conquistar as Mulheres (1966) that made Caine a star of the first magnitude. He epitomized the new breed of actor in mid-1960s England, the working-class bloke with glasses and a down-home accent. However, after initially starring in some excellent films, particularly in the 1960s, including Como Possuir Lissu (1966), Funeral em Berlim (1966), Inferno no Deserto (1969), A Batalha da Gr\u00e3-Bretanha (1969), Assim Nascem os Her\u00f3is (1970), O \u00daltimo Ref\u00fagio (1971) and especially Carter, o Vingador (1971), he seemed to take on roles in below-average films, simply for the money he could by then command.However, there were some gems amongst the dross. He gave a magnificent performance opposite Sean Connery in O Homem que Queria ser Rei (1975) and turned in a solid one as a German colonel in A \u00c1guia Pousou (1976). O Despertar de Rita (1983) and Hannah e suas Irm\u00e3s (1986) (for which he won his first Oscar) were highlights of the 1980s, while more recently Laura, a Voz de uma Estrela (1998), Regras da Vida (1999) (his second Oscar) and O \u00daltimo Adeus (2001) have been widely acclaimed. Caine played Nigel Powers in the parody sequel Austin Powers em o Homem do Membro de Ouro (2002), and Alfred Pennyworth in Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy. He appeared in several other of Nolan's films including O Grande Truque (2006), A Origem (2010) and Interestelar (2014). He also appeared as a supporting character in Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n's Filhos da Esperan\u00e7a (2006) and Pixar's sequel Carros 2 (2011).As of 2015, films in which Caine has starred have grossed over $7.4 billion worldwide. He is ranked the ninth highest grossing box office star. Caine is one of several actors nominated for an Academy Award for acting every decade from five consecutive decades (the other being Laurence Olivier and Meryl Streep). He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1992 Birthday Honours, and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in the 2000 Birthday Honours in recognition for his contributions to the cinema.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Pedro Borges\n          \n\n", "realName": "Maurice Joseph Micklewhite", "height": "188"},

Over the course of 15 years of filmmaking, Nolan has gone from low-budget independent films to working on some of the biggest blockbusters ever made.At 7 years old, Nolan began making short movies with his father's Super-8 camera. While studying English Literature at University College London, he shot 16-millimetre films at U.C.L.'s film society, where he learned the guerrilla techniques he would later use to make his first feature, Following (1998), on a budget of around $6,000. The noir thriller was recognized at a number of international film festivals prior to its theatrical release, and gained Nolan enough credibility that he was able to gather substantial financing for his next film.Nolan's second film was Amn\u00e9sia (2000), which he directed from his own screenplay based on a short story by his brother Jonathan. Starring Guy Pearce, the film brought Nolan numerous honors, including Academy Award and Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Original Screenplay. Nolan went on to direct the critically acclaimed psychological thriller, Ins\u00f4nia (2002), starring Al Pacino, Robin Williams and Hilary Swank.The turning point in Nolan's career occurred when he was awarded the chance to revive the Batman franchise in 2005. In Batman Begins (2005), Nolan brought a level of gravitas back to the iconic hero, and his gritty, modern interpretation was greeted with praise from fans and critics alike. Before moving on to a Batman sequel, Nolan directed, co-wrote, and produced the mystery thriller O Grande Truque (2006), starring Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman as magicians whose obsessive rivalry leads to tragedy and murder.In 2008, Nolan directed, co-wrote, and produced Batman: O Cavaleiro das Trevas (2008) which went on to gross more than a billion dollars at the worldwide box office. Nolan was nominated for a Directors Guild of America (D.G.A.) Award, Writers Guild of America (W.G.A.) Award and Producers Guild of America (P.G.A.) Award, and the film also received eight Academy Award nominations.In 2010, Nolan captivated audiences with the sci-fi thriller A Origem (2010), which he directed and produced from his own original screenplay. The thought-provoking drama was a worldwide blockbuster, earning more than $800,000,000 dollars and becoming one of the most discussed and debated films of the year. Among its many honors, Inception received four Academy Awards and eight nominations, including Best Picture and Best Screenplay. Nolan was recognized by his peers with D.G.A. and P.G.A. Award nominations, as well as a W.G.A. Award for his work on the film.One of the best-reviewed and highest-grossing movies of 2012, Batman: O Cavaleiro das Trevas Ressurge (2012) concluded Nolan's Batman trilogy. Due to his success rebooting the Batman character, Warner Bros. enlisted Nolan to produce their revamped Superman movie O Homem de A\u00e7o (2013), which opened in the summer of 2013. In 2014, Nolan directed, wrote, and produced the science fiction epic Interestelar (2014), starring Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain. Paramount Pictures and Warner Bros. released the film on November 5, 2014 to positive reviews and strong box-office results, grossing over $670 million dollars worldwide.Nolan resides in Los Angeles, California with his wife, producer Emma Thomas, and their children. Nolan and Thomas also have their own production company, Syncopy.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Scott Sullivan\n          \n\n", "realName": "Christopher Edward Nolan", "height": "181"},

Cobb, one of the premier character actors in American film for three decades in the post-World War II period, was born Leo Jacoby in New York City's Lower East Side on December 8, 1911. The son of a Jewish newspaper editor, young Leo was a child prodigy in music, mastering the violin and the harmonica. Any hopes of a career as a violin virtuoso were dashed when he broke his wrist, but his talent on the harmonica may have brought him his first professional success. At the age of 16 or 17 he ran away from home to Hollywood to try to break into motion pictures as an actor. He reportedly made his film debut as a member of Borrah Minevitch and His Harmonica Rascals (their first known movie appearance was in the 1929 two-reeler Boyhood Days), but that cannot be substantiated. However, it's known that after Leo was unable to find work he returned to New York City, where he attended New York University at night to study accounting while acting in radio dramas during the day.An older Cobb tried his luck in California once more, making his debut as a professional stage actor at the Pasadena Playhouse in 1931. After again returning to his native New York, he made his Broadway debut as a saloonkeeper in a dramatization of Fyodor Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment, but it closed after 15 performances (later in his career, Dostoevsky would prove more of a charm, with Cobb's role as Father Karamazov in Os Irm\u00e3os Karamazov (1958) garnering him his second Oscar nomination),Cobb joined the politically progressive Group Theater in 1935 and made a name for himself in Clifford Odets' politically liberal dramas Waiting for Lefty and Til the Day I Die, appearing in both plays that year in casts that included Elia Kazan, who later became famous as a film director. Cobb also appeared in the 1937 Group Theater production of Odets' Golden Boy, playing the role of Mr. Carp, in a cast that also included Kazan, Julius Garfinkle (later better known under his stage name of John Garfield), and Martin Ritt, all of whom later came under the scrutiny of the House Un-American Activities Committee during the heyday of the McCarthy Red Scare hysteria more than a decade later. Cobb took over the role of Mr. Bonaparte, the protagonist's father, in the 1939 film version of the play, despite the fact that he was not yet 30 years old. The role of a patriarch suited him, and he'd play many more in his film career.It was as a different kind of patriarch that he scored his greatest success. Cobb achieved immortality by giving life to the character of Willy Loman in the original 1949 Broadway production of Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman. His performance was a towering achievement that ranks with such performances as Edwin Booth as Richard III and John Barrymore as Hamlet in the annals of the American theater. Cobb later won an Emmy nomination as Willy when he played the role in a made-for-TV movie of the play (Death of a Salesman (1966)). Miller said that he wrote the role with Cobb in mind.Before triumphing as Miller's Salesman, Cobb had appeared on Broadway only a handful of times in the 1940s, including in Ernest Hemingway's The Fifth Column (1940), Odets' \"Clash by Night\" (1942) and the US Army Air Force's Winged Victory (1943-44). Later he reprised the role of Joe Bonaparte's father in the 1952 revival of Golden Boy opposite Garfield as his son, and appeared the following year in The Emperor's Clothes. His final Broadway appearance was as King Lear in the Repertory Theatre of Lincoln Center's 1968 production of Shakespeare's play.Aside from his possible late 1920s movie debut and his 1934 appearance in the western A Sombra Misteriosa (1934), Cobb's film career proper began in 1937 with the westerns Vingan\u00e7a de Irm\u00e3o (1937) (in which he was billed as Lee Colt) and O Fim da Quadrilha (1937) and spanned nearly 40 years until his death. After a hiatus while serving in the Army Air Force during World War II, Cobb's movie career resumed in 1946. He continued to play major supporting roles in prestigious A-list pictures. His movie career reached its artistic peak in the 1950s, when he was twice nominated for Best Supporting Actor Academy Awards, for his role as Johnny Friendly in Sindicato de Ladr\u00f5es (1954) and as the father in Os Irm\u00e3os Karamazov (1958). Other memorable supporting roles in the 1950s included the sagacious Judge Bernstein in O Homem do Terno Cinzento (1956), as the probing psychiatrist Dr. Luther in As Tr\u00eas M\u00e1scaras de Eva (1957) and as the volatile Juror #3 in 12 Homens e uma Senten\u00e7a (1957).It was in the 1950s that Cobb achieved the sort of fame that most artists dreaded: he was called before the House Un-American Activities Committee on charges that he was or had been a Communist. The charges were rooted in Cobb's membership in the Group Theater in the 1930s. Other Group Theater members already investigated by HUAC included Clifford Odets and Elia Kazan, both of whom provided friendly testimony before the committee, and John Garfield, who did not.Cobb's own persecution by HUAC had already caused a nervous breakdown in his wife, and he decided to appear as a friendly witness in order to preserve her sanity and his career, by bringing the inquisition to a halt. Appearing before the committee in 1953, he named names and thus saved his career. Ironically, he would win his first Oscar nomination in Sindicato de Ladr\u00f5es (1954) directed and written by fellow HUAC informers Kazan and Budd Schulberg. The film can be seen as a stalwart defense of informing, as epitomized by the character Terry Malloy's testimony before a Congressional committee investigating racketeering on the waterfront.Major films in which Cobb appeared after reaching his career plateau include Otto Preminger's adaptation of Leon Uris' ode to the birth of Israel, Exodus (1960); the Cinerama spectacle A Conquista do Oeste (1962); the James Coburn spy spoofs, Flint Contra o G\u00eanio do Mal (1966) and Flint: Perigo Supremo (1967); Clint Eastwood's first detective film, Meu Nome \u00e9 Coogan (1968); and legendary director William Wyler's last film, A Liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de L. B. Jones (1970).In addition to his frequent supporting roles in film, Cobb often appeared on television. He played Judge Henry Garth on O Homem de Virg\u00ednia (1962) from 1962-66 and also had a regular role as the attorney David Barrett on The Young Lawyers (1969) from 1970-71. Cobb also appeared in made-for-TV movies and made frequent guest appearances on other TV shows. His last major Hollywood movie role was that of police detective Lt. Kinderman in O Exorcista (1973).Lee J. Cobb died of a heart attack in Woodland Hills, California, on February 11, 1976, at the age of 64. He is buried in Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles, California. Though he will long be remembered for many of his successful supporting performances in the movies, it is as the stage's first Willy Loman in which he achieved immortality as an actor. Bearing in mind that the role was written for him, it is through Willy that he will continue to have an influence on American drama far into the future, for as long as Death of a Salesman is revived.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Jon C.

He was the first-born child. His father was a Russian Jewish immigrant, and his mother was born in New York, to Russian Jewish parents. Martin caught the acting bug in high school where he participated in the drama club. After high school, he continued his interest in acting by attending Manhattan's progressive New School. When World War II broke out, Martin was called to service in his early twenties. After the war, he was lucky to secure a position as an usher at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. By 1947, he was honing his craft at the Actors Studio, run at that time by Elia Kazan and Lee Strasberg. His time at the Actors Studio in New York City allowed him training in the famous Stanislavsky method. Despite his excellent training, he had to prove himself, just like any up and coming young actor. He began on Broadway in the late 1940s. But, it was not until 1951 that he experienced real success. That play was Tennessee Williams' \"The Rose Tattoo\". After his Broadway success, he had a few minor television roles before his big break arrived when he joined the cast of Sindicato de Ladr\u00f5es (1954). In the 1950s, Martin had many television roles. He had recurring roles on some of the most popular television series of that time, including The United States Steel Hour (1953), The Philco Television Playhouse (1948), Goodyear Television Playhouse (1951) and Studio One (1948). In 1957, he was able to prove himself on the big-screen once again, with a prominent role in 12 Homens e uma Senten\u00e7a (1957), directed by Sidney Lumet and starring Henry Fonda. All of Martin's television work in the 1950s did not go to waste. While starring on an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1955), Hitchcock was so impressed by his work, that he offered him a key supporting role of Detective Milton Arbogast in Psicose (1960). His work with Hitchcock opened him up to a world of other acting opportunities. Many strong movie roles came his way in the 1960s, including parts in Bonequinha de Luxo (1961), C\u00edrculo do Medo (1962) and Os Insaci\u00e1veis (1964). One of the proudest moments in his life was when he received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for Mil Palha\u00e7os (1965). It was soon after that he began accepting roles in European movies. He soon developed a love for Italy, and lived there most of his remaining years. He acted in over a dozen Italian movies and spent his later life traveling between Hollywood and Europe for his many roles. After a career that spanned more than fifty years, Martin Balsam died of natural causes in his beloved Italy at age 76. He passed away of a stroke at a hotel in Rome called Residenza di Repetta. He was survived by his third wife Irene Miller and three children, Adam, Zoe and Talia.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Irishlass240 (smmorr240@aol.com)\n          \n\n", "realName": "Martin Henry Balsam", "height": "170"},

He made over 40 movies, often complex and emotional, but seldom overly sentimental. Although his politics were somewhat left-leaning and he often treated socially relevant themes in his films, Lumet didn't want to make political movies in the first place. Born on June 25, 1924, in Philadelphia, the son of actor Baruch Lumet and dancer Eugenia Wermus Lumet, he made his stage debut at age four at the Yiddish Art Theater in New York. He played many roles on Broadway in the 1930s and also in the film Os Deserdados (1939). After starting an off-Broadway acting troupe in the late 1940s, he became the director of many television shows in the 1950s. Lumet made his feature film directing debut with 12 Homens e uma Senten\u00e7a (1957), which won the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival and earned three Academy Award nominations. The courtroom drama, which takes place almost entirely in a jury room, is justly regarded as one of the most auspicious directorial debuts in film history. Lumet got the chance to direct Marlon Brando in Vidas em Fuga (1960), an imperfect, but powerful adaptation of Tennessee Williams' \"Orpheus Descending\". The first half of the 1960s was one of Lumet's most artistically successful periods. Longa Jornada Noite Adentro (1962), a masterful, brilliantly photographed adaptation of the Eugene O'Neill play, is one of several Lumet films about families. It earned Katharine Hepburn, Ralph Richardson, Dean Stockwell and Jason Robards deserved acting awards in Cannes and Hepburn an Oscar nomination. The alarming Cold War thriller Limite de Seguran\u00e7a (1964) unfairly suffered from comparison to Stanley Kubrick's equally great satire Dr. Fant\u00e1stico (1964), which was released shortly before. O Homem do Prego (1964), arguably the most outstanding of the great movies Lumet made in this phase, tells the story of a Holocaust survivor who lives in New York and can't overcome his experiences in the Nazi concentration camps. Rod Steiger's unforgettable performance in the title role earned an Academy Award nomination. Lumet's intense character study A Colina dos Homens Perdidos (1965) about inhumanity in a military prison camp was the first of five films he did with Sean Connery. After the overly talky but rewarding drama O Grupo (1966) about young upper-class women in the 1930s, and the stylish spy thriller Chamada para um Morto (1967), the late 1960s turned out to be a lesser phase in Lumet's career. He had a strong comeback with the box-office hit O Golpe de John Anderson (1971). At\u00e9 os Deuses Erram (1973) was commercially less successful, but artistically brilliant - with Connery in one of his most impressive performances. The terrific cop thriller Serpico (1973), the first of his films about police corruption in New York City, became one of his biggest critical and financial successes. Al Pacino's fascinating portrayal of the real-life cop Frank Serpico earned a Golden Globe and the movie earned two Academy Award nominations (it is worth noting that Lumet's feature films of the 1970s alone earned 30 Oscar nominations, winning six times). The love triangle Lovin' Molly (1974) was not always convincing in its atmospheric details, but Lumet's fine sense of emotional truth and a good Blythe Danner keep it interesting. The adaptation of Agatha Christie's Assassinato no Expresso Oriente (1974), an exquisitely photographed murder mystery with an all-star cast, was a big success again. Lumet's complex crime thriller Um Dia de C\u00e3o (1975), which Pauline Kael called \"one of the best \"New York\" movies ever made\", gave Al Pacino the opportunity for a breathtaking, three-dimensional portrayal of a bisexual man who tries to rob a bank to finance his lover's sex-change operation. Lumet's next masterpiece, Rede de Intrigas (1976), was a prophetic satire on media and society. The film version of Peter Shaffer's stage play Equus (1977) about a doctor and his mentally confused patient was also powerful, not least because of the energetic acting by Richard Burton and Peter Firth. After the enjoyable musical O M\u00e1gico Inesquec\u00edvel (1978) and the interesting but not easily accessible comedy Diga-me o que Voc\u00ea Quer (1980), Sidney Lumet won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for his outstanding direction of O Pr\u00edncipe da Cidade (1981), one of his best and most typical films. It's about police corruption, but hardly a remake of Serpico (1973). Starring a powerful Treat Williams, it's an extraordinarily multi-layered film. In his highly informative book \"Making Movies\" (1995), Lumet describes the film in the following way: \"When we try to control everything, everything winds up controlling us. Nothing is what it seems.\" It's also a movie about values, friendship and drug addiction and, like \"Serpico\", is based on a true story. In Armadilha Mortal (1982), Lumet successfully blended suspense and black humor. O Veredicto (1982) was voted the fourth greatest courtroom drama of all time by the American Film Institute in 2008. A few minor inaccuracies in legal details do not mar this study of an alcoholic lawyer (superbly embodied by Paul Newman) aiming to regain his self-respect through a malpractice case. The expertly directed movie received five Academy Award nominations. Lumet's controversial drama Daniel (1983) with Timothy Hutton, an adaptation of E.L. Doctorow's \"The Book of Daniel\" about two young people whose parents were executed during the McCarthy Red Scare hysteria in the 1950s for alleged espionage, is one of his underrated achievements. His later masterpiece O Peso de um Passado (1988) has a similar theme, portraying a family which has been on the run from the FBI since the parents (played by Christine Lahti and Judd Hirsch) committed a bomb attack on a napalm laboratory in 1971 to protest the war in Vietnam. The son (played by River Phoenix in an extraordinarily moving, Oscar-nominated performance) falls in love with a girl and wishes to stay with her and study music. Naomi Foner's screenplay won the Golden Globe. Other Lumet movies of the 1980s are the melancholic comedy drama Fala Greta Garbo (1984); the occasionally clich\u00e9d Os Donos do Poder (1986) about election campaigns; the all too slow thriller A Manh\u00e3 Seguinte (1986) and the amusing gangster comedy Neg\u00f3cios de Fam\u00edlia (1989). With Q & A - Sem Lei, Sem Justi\u00e7a (1990) Lumet returned to the genre of the New York cop thriller. Nick Nolte shines in the role of a corrupt and racist detective in this multi-layered, strangely underrated film. Sadly, with the exception of Sombras da Lei (1996), an imperfect but fascinating crime drama in the tradition of his own previous genre works, almost none of Lumet's works of the 1990s did quite get the attention they deserved. The crime drama Uma Estranha Entre N\u00f3s (1992) blended genres in a way that did not seem to match most viewers' expectations, but its contemplations about life arouse interest. The intelligent hospital satire O Impaciente (1997) was unfairly neglected as well. The courtroom thriller Culpado como o Pecado (1993) was cold but intriguing. Lumet's Gl\u00f3ria, a Mulher (1999) remake seemed unnecessary, but he returned impressively with the underestimated courtroom comedy Sob Suspeita (2006) and the justly acclaimed crime thriller Antes que o Diabo Saiba que Voc\u00ea Est\u00e1 Morto (2007). In 2005, Sidney Lumet received a well-deserved honorary Academy Award for his outstanding contribution to filmmaking. Sidney Lumet tragically died of cancer in 2011.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Karl Rackwitz <rackwitz.karl@gmx.de>\n          \n\n", "realName": "Sidney Arthur Lumet", "height": "165"},

He was raised in a Catholic household. During his early years, Liam worked as a forklift operator for Guinness, a truck driver, an assistant architect and an amateur boxer. He had originally sought a career as a teacher by attending St. Mary's Teaching College, Newcastle. However, in 1976, Neeson joined the Belfast Lyric Players' Theater and made his professional acting debut in the play \"The Risen People\". After two years, Neeson moved to Dublin's Abbey Theater where he performed the classics. It was here that he was spotted by director John Boorman and was cast in the film Excalibur, a Espada do Poder (1981) as Sir Gawain, his first high-profile film role.Through the 1980s Neeson appeared in a handful of films and British TV series - including Rebeli\u00e3o em Alto Mar (1984), A Woman of Substance (1984), A Miss\u00e3o (1986), and Sede de Amar (1986) - but it was not until he moved to Hollywood to pursue larger roles that he began to get noticed. His turn as a mute homeless man in Sob Suspeita (1987) garnered good reviews, as did supporting roles in O Pre\u00e7o da Paix\u00e3o (1988) and Com Fantasmas N\u00e3o se Brinca (1988) - though he also starred in the best-to-be-forgotten Satisfaction: No Amor e no Rock (1988), which also featured a then-unknown Julia Roberts - but leading man status eluded him until the cult favorite Darkman: Vingan\u00e7a sem Rosto (1990), directed by Sam Raimi. From there, Neeson starred in A Sombra de uma Suspeita (1991) and Ethan Frome, um Amor para Sempre (1993), was hailed for his performance in Woody Allen's Maridos e Esposas (1992), and ultimately was picked by Steven Spielberg to play Oskar Schindler in A Lista de Schindler (1993). The starring role in the Oscar-winning Holocaust film brought Neeson Academy Award, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations for Best Actor.Also in 1993, he made his Broadway debut with a Tony-nominated performance in \"Anna Christie\", in which he co-starred with his future wife Natasha Richardson. The next year, the two also starred opposite Jodie Foster in the movie Nell (1994), and were married in July of that year. Leading roles as the 18th century Scottish Highlander Rob Roy, a Saga de uma Paix\u00e3o (1995) and the Irish revolutionary leader Michael Collins, o Pre\u00e7o da Liberdade (1996) followed, and soon Neeson was solidified as one of Hollywood's top leading men. He starred in the highly-anticipated Star Wars, Epis\u00f3dio I: A Amea\u00e7a Fantasma (1999) as Qui-Gon Jinn, received a Golden Globe nomination for Kinsey: Vamos Falar de Sexo (2004), played the mysterious Ducard in Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins (2005), and provided the voice for Aslan in As Cr\u00f4nicas de N\u00e1rnia: O Le\u00e3o, a Feiticeira e o Guarda-Roupa (2005).Neeson found a second surprise career as an action leading man with the release of Busca Implac\u00e1vel (2008) in early 2009, an unexpected box office hit about a retired CIA agent attempting to rescue his daughter from being sold into prostitution. However, less than two months after the release of the film, tragedy struck when his wife Natasha Richardson suffered a fatal head injury while skiing and passed away days afterward. Neeson returned to high-profile roles in 2010 with two back-to-back big-budget films, F\u00faria de Tit\u00e3s (2010) and Esquadr\u00e3o Classe A (2010), and returned to the action genre with Desconhecido (2011), A Persegui\u00e7\u00e3o (2011), Battleship: A Batalha dos Mares (2012) and Busca Implac\u00e1vel 2 (2012), as well as the sequel F\u00faria de Tit\u00e3s 2 (2012).Neeson was awarded Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1999 Queen's New Year's Honours List for his services to drama. He has two sons from his marriage to Richardson: Micheal Richard Antonio Neeson (born June 22, 1995) and Daniel Jack Neeson (born August 27, 1996).\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Tony Fontana <tony.fontana@spacebbs.com>\n          \n\n", "realName": "William John Neeson", "height": "193"},

Fiennes first worked on screen in 1990 and then made his film debut in 1992 as Heathcliff in Emily Bront\u00eb's O Morro dos Ventos Uivantes (1992), opposite Juliette Binoche. 1993 was his \"breakout year\". He had a major role in the controversial Peter Greenaway film O Beb\u00ea Santo de M\u00e2con (1993), with Julia Ormond, which was poorly received. Later that year he became known internationally for portraying the amoral Nazi concentration camp commandant Amon Goeth in Steven Spielberg's A Lista de Schindler (1993). For this he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor. He did not win, but did win the Best Supporting Actor BAFTA Award for the role, as well as Best Supporting Actor honors from numerous critics groups, including the National Society of Film Critics, and the New York, Chicago, Boston, and London Film Critics associations. His portrayal as G\u00f6th also earned him a spot on the American Film Institute's list of Top 50 Film Villains. To look suitable to represent Goeth, Fiennes gained weight, but he managed to shed it afterwards. In 1994, he portrayed American academic Charles Van Doren in Quiz Show: A Verdade dos Bastidores (1994).

Ben began to act in stage plays during the 1960s. He soon became a successful stage actor, and also began to have roles in films and television. His birth name was Krishna Bhanji, but he changed his name to \"Ben Kingsley\" soon after gaining fame as a stage actor, fearing that a foreign name could hamper his acting career.Kingsley first earned international fame for his performance in the drama movie Gandhi (1982).

He has an extraordinary number of commercially successful and critically acclaimed credits to his name, either as a director, producer or writer since launching the summer blockbuster with Tubar\u00e3o (1975), and he has done more to define popular film-making since the mid-1970s than anyone else.Steven Allan Spielberg was born in 1946 in Cincinnati, Ohio, to Leah Frances (Posner), a concert pianist and restaurateur, and Arnold Spielberg, an electrical engineer who worked in computer development. His parents were both born to Russian Jewish immigrant families. Steven spent his younger years in Haddon Township, New Jersey, Phoenix, Arizona, and later Saratoga, California. He went to California State University Long Beach, but dropped out to pursue his entertainment career. He gained notoriety as an uncredited assistant editor on the classic western Caravana (1957). Among his early directing efforts were Battle Squad (1961), which combined World War II footage with footage of an airplane on the ground that he makes you believe is moving. He also directed Escape to Nowhere (1961), which featured children as World War Two soldiers, including his sister Anne Spielberg, and The Last Gun (1959), a western. All of these were short films. The next couple of years, Spielberg directed a couple of movies that would portend his future career in movies. In 1964, he directed Firelight (1964), a movie about aliens invading a small town. In 1967, he directed Slipstream (1967), which was unfinished. However, in 1968, he directed Amblin' (1968), which featured the desert prominently, and not the first of his movies in which the desert would feature so prominently. Amblin' also became the name of his production company, which turned out such classics as E.T.: O Extraterrestre (1982). Spielberg had a unique and classic early directing project, Encurralado (1971), with Dennis Weaver. In the early 1970s, Spielberg was working on TV, directing among others such series as Rod Serling's Galeria do Terror (1969), Marcus Welby, M.D. (1969) and Columbo: Murder by the Book (1971). All of his work in television and short films, as well as his directing projects, were just a hint of the wellspring of talent that would dazzle audiences all over the world.Spielberg's first major directorial effort was A Louca Escapada (1974), with Goldie Hawn, a film that marked him as a rising star. It was his next effort, however, that made him an international superstar among directors: Tubar\u00e3o (1975). This classic shark attack tale started the tradition of the summer blockbuster or, at least, he was credited with starting the tradition. His next film was the classic Contatos Imediatos do Terceiro Grau (1977), a unique and original UFO story that remains a classic. In 1978, Spielberg produced his first film, the forgettable Febre de Juventude (1978), and followed that effort with Carros Usados (1980), a critically acclaimed, but mostly forgotten, Kurt Russell\\\\Jack Warden comedy about devious used-car dealers. Spielberg hit gold yet one more time with Indiana Jones e os Ca\u00e7adores da Arca Perdida (1981), with Harrison Ford taking the part of Indiana Jones. Spielberg produced and directed two films in 1982. The first was Poltergeist: O Fen\u00f4meno (1982), but the highest-grossing movie of all time up to that point was the alien story E.T.: O Extraterrestre (1982). Spielberg also helped pioneer the practice of product placement. The concept, while not uncommon, was still relatively low-key when Spielberg raised the practice to almost an art form with his famous (or infamous) placement of Reese's Pieces in \"E.T.\" Spielberg was also one of the pioneers of the big-grossing special-effects movies, like \"E.T.\" and \"Close Encounters\", where a very strong emphasis on special effects was placed for the first time on such a huge scale. In 1984, Spielberg followed up \"Raiders\" with Indiana Jones e o Templo da Perdi\u00e7\u00e3o (1984), which was a commercial success but did not receive the critical acclaim of its predecessor. As a producer, Spielberg took on many projects in the 1980s, such as Os Goonies (1985), and was the brains behind the little monsters in Gremlins (1984). He also produced the cartoon Um Conto Americano (1986), a quaint little animated classic. His biggest effort as producer in 1985, however, was the blockbuster De Volta para o Futuro (1985), which made Michael J. Fox an instant superstar. As director, Spielberg took on the book A Cor P\u00farpura (1985), with Whoopi Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey, with great success. In the latter half of the 1980s, he also directed Imp\u00e9rio do Sol (1987), a mixed success for the occasionally erratic Spielberg. Success would not escape him for long, though.The late 1980s found Spielberg's projects at the center of pop-culture yet again. In 1988, he produced the landmark animation/live-action film Uma Cilada para Roger Rabbit (1988). The next year proved to be another big one for Spielberg, as he produced and directed Al\u00e9m da Eternidade (1989) as well as Indiana Jones e a \u00daltima Cruzada (1989), and De Volta para o Futuro II (1989). All three of the films were box-office and critical successes. Also, in 1989, he produced the little known comedy-drama Meu Pai, uma Li\u00e7\u00e3o de Vida (1989), with Jack Lemmon and Ted Danson, which got mostly mixed results. Spielberg has also had an affinity for animation and has been a strong voice in animation in the 1990s. Aside from producing the landmark \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\", he produced the animated series Tiny Toon (1990), Animaniacs (1993), Pinky e o C\u00e9rebro (1995), Freakazoid! (1995), Pinky, Fel\u00edcia e o C\u00e9rebro (1998), Vida de Cachorro (1993) and Toonsylvania (1998). Spielberg also produced other cartoons such as Em Busca do Vale Encantado (1988), Os Dinossauros Voltaram (1993), Gasparzinho, o Fantasminha Camarada (1995) (the live action version) as well as the live-action version of Os Flintstones: O Filme (1994), where he was credited as \"Steven Spielrock\". Spielberg also produced many Roger Rabbit short cartoons, and many Pinky and the Brain, Animaniacs and Tiny Toons specials. Spielberg was very active in the early 1990s, as he directed Hook, a Volta do Capit\u00e3o Gancho (1991) and produced such films as the cute fantasy Joe Contra o Vulc\u00e3o (1990) and Um Conto Americano: Fievel Vai para o Oeste (1991). He also produced the unusual comedy thriller Aracnofobia (1990), De Volta para o Futuro III (1990) and Gremlins 2: A Nova Gera\u00e7\u00e3o (1990). While these movies were big successes in their own right, they did not quite bring in the kind of box office or critical acclaim as previous efforts. In 1993, Spielberg directed Jurassic Park: O Parque dos Dinossauros (1993), which for a short time held the record as the highest grossing movie of all time, but did not have the universal appeal of his previous efforts. Big box-office spectacles were not his only concern, though. He produced and directed A Lista de Schindler (1993), a stirring film about the Holocaust. He won best director at the Oscars, and also got Best Picture. In the mid-90s, he helped found the production company DreamWorks, which was responsible for many box-office successes.As a producer, he was very active in the late 90s, responsible for such films as A M\u00e1scara do Zorro (1998), MIB: Homens de Preto (1997) and Impacto Profundo (1998). However, it was on the directing front that Spielberg was in top form. He directed and produced the epic Amistad (1997), a spectacular film that was shorted at the Oscars and in release due to the fact that its release date was moved around so much in late 1997. The next year, however, produced what many believe was one of the best films of his career: O Resgate do Soldado Ryan (1998), a film about World War Two that is spectacular in almost every respect. It was stiffed at the Oscars, losing best picture to Shakespeare Apaixonado (1998).Spielberg produced a series of films, including Evolu\u00e7\u00e3o (2001), A Casa Amaldi\u00e7oada (1999) and Shrek (2001). he also produced two sequels to Jurassic Park: O Parque dos Dinossauros (1993), which were financially but not particularly critical successes. In 2001, he produced a mini-series about World War Two that definitely *was* a financial and critical success: Irm\u00e3os de Guerra (2001), a tale of an infantry company from its parachuting into France during the invasion to the Battle of the Bulge. Also in that year, Spielberg was back in the director's chair for A.I.: Intelig\u00eancia Artificial (2001), a movie with a message and a huge budget. It did reasonably at the box office and garnered varied reviews from critics.Spielberg has been extremely active in films there are many other things he has done as well. He produced the short-lived TV series Seaquest DSV (1993), an anthology series entitled Hist\u00f3rias Maravilhosas (1985), created the video-game series \"Medal of Honor\" set during World War Two, and was a starting producer of Plant\u00e3o M\u00e9dico (1994). Spielberg, if you haven't noticed, has a great interest in World War Two. He and Tom Hanks collaborated on Shooting War (2000), a documentary about World War II combat photographers, and he produced a documentary about the Holocaust called A Holocaust szemei (2000). With all of this to Spielberg's credit, it's no wonder that he's looked at as one of the greatest ever figures in entertainment.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Scott msa0510@mail.ecu.edu\n          \n\n", "realName": "Steven Allan Spielberg", "height": "172"},

In addition to reprising the role in The Hobbit series, Wood also played Ryan in the FX television comedy Wilfred (2011) and voiced Beck in the Disney XD animated television series Tron: A Resist\u00eancia (2012).Born Elijah Jordan Wood on 28 January, 1981, in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Wood is the son of Debbie (Krause) and Warren Wood, who ran a delicatessen. He has an older brother, Zach, and a younger sister, Hannah Wood. He is of English, German, Austrian, and Danish descent. Demonstrating a gift for performing at a young age, Wood's natural talent inspired his mother to take him to an International Modeling and Talent Association annual convention in Los Angeles. Soon after, he began to get bookings for small parts on television.Although his first credit was a small part in De Volta para o Futuro II (1989), Wood's first major film role was in the 'Barry Levinson' historical family drama Avalon (1990). Following that, Wood became an in-demand child actor, appearing in a number of major films such as Para\u00edso (1991), Radio Flyer (1992) and O Anjo Malvado (1993), in which he co-starred with Macaulay Culkin. This was followed by the first role for which he received top-billing, O Anjo da Guarda (1994). Although the film was widely condemned and a disaster at the box office, Elijah was praised as the only good thing to come out of it.In 1996 Elijah starred in a movie remake of an old TV show, Flipper (1996). Many critics wondered if his ability as a child actor to capture an audience was wearing thin, as had many child actors', but Wood deftly transitioned into a versatile performer with roles such as the endlessly curious Mikey Carver in Ang Lee' ensemble film Tempestade de Gelo (1997), as well as parts in popcorn flicks like Impacto Profundo (1998) and Prova Final (1998). In 1999, Elijah was in three movies that never made it into wide release: Peda\u00e7os de uma Vida (1999) (released on satellite TV), Preto e Branco (1999) (released on home video) and Roubos e Trapa\u00e7as (2000).Wood's work in Peter Jackson's film adaptations of J.R.R. Tolkien's O Senhor dos An\u00e9is: A Sociedade do Anel (2001), O Senhor dos An\u00e9is: As Duas Torres (2002), and O Senhor dos An\u00e9is: O Retorno do Rei (2003), provided a major boost to his career. The actor followed his work in the astronomically successful trilogy with a broad range of interesting screen roles and voice work, including a supporting role in Michel Gondry's Brilho Eterno de uma Mente sem Lembran\u00e7as (2004), as well as the part of a sinister mute sociopath in Sin City: A Cidade do Pecado (2005). His voice work has been featured in such animated films as Happy Feet: O Pinguim (2006) and 9: A Salva\u00e7\u00e3o (2009), as well as on television series including American Dad!

His parents met in Norway. They wed and moved to New York, where Viggo, Jr. was born, before moving to South America, where Viggo, Sr. managed chicken farms and ranches in Venezuela and Argentina. Two more sons were born, Charles and Walter, before the marriage grew increasingly unhappy. When Viggo was seven, his parents sent him to a a strict boarding school, isolated in the foothills of the mountains of Argentina. Then, at age eleven, his parents divorced. His mother moved herself and the children back to her home state of New York.Viggo attended Watertown High School, and became a very good student and athlete. He graduated in 1976 and went on to St. Lawrence University in Canton, New York. After graduation, he moved to Denmark - driven by the need for a defining purpose in life. He began writing poetry and short stories while working many odd jobs, from dock worker to flower seller. In 1982, he fell in love and followed his girlfriend back to New York City, hoping for a long romance and a writing career. He got neither. In New York, Viggo found work waiting tables and bar tending and began taking acting classes, studying with Warren Robertson. He appeared in several plays and movies, and eventually moved to Los Angeles, where his performance in \"Bent\" at the Coast Playhouse earned him a Drama-logue Critic's Award.He made his film debut with a small part in A Testemunha (1985). He appeared in Salvation!: Have You Said Your Prayers Today? (1987) and married his co-star, Exene Cervenka. The two had a son, Henry Mortensen. But after nearly eleven years of marriage, the couple divorced.In 1999, Viggo got a phone call about a movie he did not know anything about: The Lord of the Rings. At first, he didn't want to do it, because it would mean time away from his son. But Henry, a big fan of the books, told his father he shouldn't turn down the role. Viggo accepted the part and immediately began work on the project, which was already underway. Eventually, the success of Lord of the Rings made him a household name - a difficult consequence for the ever private and introspective Viggo.Critics have continually recognized his work in over thirty movies, including such diverse projects as Jane Campion's Retratos de uma Mulher (1996), Sean Penn's Unidos Pelo Sangue (1991), Brian De Palma's O Pagamento Final (1993), Ridley Scott's At\u00e9 o Limite da Honra (1997), Tony Scott's Mar\u00e9 Vermelha (1995), Andrew Davis's Um Crime Perfeito (1998), Ray Loriga's La pistola de mi hermano (1997), Tony Goldwyn's A Walk on the Moon (1999), and Peter Farrelly's Green Book: O Guia (2018).Mortensen is also an accomplished poet, photographer and painter.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Grace Z and J.W.

He is of Scottish, Northern Irish, and English descent. During his early childhood, his parents moved with Ian and his older sister, Jean, to the mill town of Wigan. It was in this small town that young Ian rode out World War II. He soon developed a fascination with acting and the theatre, which was encouraged by his parents. They would take him to plays, those by William Shakespeare, in particular. The amateur school productions fostered Ian's growing passion for theatre.When Ian was of age to begin attending school, he made sure to get roles in all of the productions. At Bolton School in particular, he developed his skills early on. Indeed, his first role in a Shakespearian play was at Bolton, as Malvolio in \"Twelfth Night\". Ian soon began attending Stratford-upon-Avon theatre festivals, where he saw the greats perform: Laurence Olivier, Wendy Hiller, John Gielgud, Ralph Richardson and Paul Robeson. He continued his education in English Drama, but soon it fell by the wayside as he concentrated more and more on performing. He eventually obtained his Bachelor of Arts in 1961, and began his career in earnest.McKellen began working in theatre over the next few years. Very few people knew of Ian's homosexuality; he saw no reason to go public, nor had he told his family. They did not seem interested in the subject and so he saw no reason to bring it up. In 1988, Ian publicly came out of the closet on the BBC Radio 4 program, while discussing Margaret Thatcher's \"Section 28\" legislation, which made the promotion of homosexuality as a family relationship by local authorities an offense. It was reason enough for McKellen to take a stand. He has been active in the gay rights movement ever since.Ian resides in Limehouse, where he has also lived with his former long-time partner Sean Mathias. The two men have also worked together on the film Bent (1997) as well as in exquisite stage productions. To this day, McKellen works mostly in theatre, and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1990 for his efforts in the arts. However, he has managed to make several quite successful forays into film. He has appeared in several productions of Shakespeare's works including his well received Ricardo III (1995), and in a variety of other movies. However, it has only been recently that his star has finally begun to shine in the eyes of North American audiences. Roles in various films, Em Busca da Felicidade (1995), O Aprendiz (1998) and Deuses e Monstros (1998), riveted audiences. The latter, in particular, created a sensation in Hollywood, and McKellen's role garnered him several of awards and nominations, including a Golden Globe and an Oscar nod. McKellen, as he continues to work extensively on stage, he always keeps in 'solidifying' his 'role' as Laurence Olivier's worthy 'successor' in the best sense too, such as King Lear (2008) / Great Performances: King Lear (2008) directed by Trevor Nunn and in a range of other staggering performances full of generously euphoric delight that have included \"Peter Pan\" and No\u00ebl Coward's \"Present Laughter\", as well as Samuel Beckett's \"Waiting for Godot\" and Harold Pinter's \"No Man's Land\" (National Theatre Live: No Man's Land (2016)), both in acclaimed productions brilliantly directed by Sean Mathias.McKellen found mainstream success with his performance as Magneto in X-Men: O Filme (2000) and its sequels. His largest mark on the big screen may be as Gandalf in \"The Lord of the Rings\" film trilogy directed by Peter Jackson, which he reprised in \"The Hobbit\" trilogy. He also reprised the role of 'King Lear' with new artistic perspectives in National Theatre Live: King Lear (2018) offering an invaluable mesmerizing experience as a natural force of stage - and screen - of infinite generosity through his unsurpassable interpretation of the titanically vulnerable king.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Peacham and Markos.\n          \n\n", "realName": "Ian Murray McKellen", "height": "180"},

His mother, Sonia Constance Josephine (Copeland), was born in Kolkata, India, to an English family then-resident there. The man he first knew as his father, Harry Bloom, was a legendary political activist who fought for civil rights in South Africa. But Harry died of a stroke when Orlando was only four years old. After that, Orlando and his older sister, Samantha Bloom, were raised by their mother and family friend, Colin Stone. When Orlando was 13, Sonia revealed to him that Colin is actually the biological father of Orlando and his sister; the two were conceived after an agreement by his parents, since Harry, who suffered a stroke in 1975, was unable to have children.Orlando attended St. Edmund's School in Canterbury but struggled in many courses because of dyslexia. He did embrace the arts, however, and enjoyed pottery, photography and sculpturing. He also participated in school plays and was active at his local theater. As a teen, Orlando landed his first job: he was a clay trapper at a pigeon shooting range. Encouraged by his mother, he and his sister began studying poetry and prose, eventually giving readings at Kent Festival. Orlando and Samantha won many poetry and Bible reciting competitions. Then Orlando, who always idolized larger-than-life characters, gravitated towards serious acting. At the age of 16, he moved to London and joined the National Youth Theatre, spending two seasons there and gaining a scholarship to train with the British American Drama Academy. Like many young actors, he also auditioned for a number of television roles to further his career, landing bit parts in British television shows Casualty (1986), Midsomer Murders (1997) and Smack the Pony (1999). He also appeared in the critically acclaimed movie Wilde - O Primeiro Homem Moderno (1997).He then attended the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. It was there, in 1998, that Orlando fell three stories from a rooftop terrace and broke his back. Despite fears that he would be permanently paralyzed, he quickly recovered and returned to the stage. As fate would have it, seated in the audience one night in 1999 was a director named Peter Jackson. After the show, he met with Orlando and asked him to audition for his new set of movies. After graduating from Guildhall, Orlando began work on the \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy, spending 18 months in New Zealand bringing to life \"Legolas\", a part which made him a household name. Today, he is one of the busiest and most sought-after actors in the industry.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            J.W.

When a friend of his parents bought him a super 8 movie camera (because she saw how much he enjoyed taking photos), the then eight-year-old Peter instantly grabbed the thing to start recording his own movies, which he made with his friends. They were usually short, but they already had the trademark that would make Jackson famous: impressive special effects, made at a very low cost. For example, for his film \"World War Two\" which he made as a teenager, he used to simulate a firing gun by punching little holes into the celluloid, so that, once projected, the gun gave the impression of displaying a small fire. Jackson's first step towards more serious film-making came with an entry in a local contest to stimulate amateur and children's films. For this film, he used stop-motion animation to create a monster that ruins a city in the style of Ray Harryhausen. Unfortunately, he didn't win. At twenty-two, he embarked on a movie-making adventure that would change his life. This film, Trash - N\u00e1usea Total (1987), was begun as any other Jackson film, in an amateur style, at a low budget and using friends and local people to star in his film. Jackson himself did nearly everything in the movie; he directed, produced, filmed and starred in it, in a number of roles, amongst them that of the hero, \"Derek\". And everything was filmed on a second-hand, $250 camera. It took Jackson and his friends four years to complete the movie. What had started as a joke in a group of friends, then became a cult classic. A friend of Jackson who was working in the movie industry convinced him the film had commercial prospects and arranged for it to be shown at the Cannes film festival, where it won a lot of acclaim, as well as a number of prizes. The movie soon became a hit because of its bizarre humor and overdose of special effects, some realistic, some comedically amateur. After the success of Trash - N\u00e1usea Total (1987), Jackson became recognized as a director and the door to fame and fortune was opened. He gave up his job at a local photographer's shop and became a well-known director of horror-movies, after the success of his first professionally made movie, Fome Animal (1992).\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            T. van der Sluijs\n          \n\n", "realName": null, "height": "169"},

He decided to combine all three of these skills and become a musical comedy performer. At 16 he landed his first professional job in a summer stock production of the musical \"Bye Bye Birdie\". He quit school at 16 and moved to New York, and worked regularly in summer stock and on television commercials. When work became scarce in New York, he went to Hollywood and appeared in minor roles in several series. A role in the national touring company of the hit 1950s musical \"Grease\" brought him back to New York. An opening in the New York production of \"Grease\" gave him his first Broadway role at age 18. After \"Grease\", he became a member of the company of the Broadway show \"Over Here\", which starred The Andrews Sisters. After ten months in \"Over Here\", he decided to try Hollywood once again. Once back in Hollywood, he had little trouble getting roles in numerous television shows. He was seen on Os Novatos (1972), Emergency! (1972) and Medical Center (1969) and also made a movie, A Chuva do Diabo (1975), which was shot in New Mexico.

		{"id": 34, "artistName": "Uma Thurman", "birthPlace": "Boston, Massachusetts, USA", "birthDate": "1970-04-29", "deathDate": null, "pictureurl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMxNzk1MTQyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIzMDEyMTE@._V1_.jpg", "bio": "\n\n              Uma Karuna Thurman was born in Boston, Massachusetts, into a highly unorthodox and internationally-minded family. She is the daughter of Nena Thurman (n\u00e9e Birgitte Caroline von Schlebr\u00fcgge), a fashion model and socialite who now runs a mountain retreat, and of Robert Thurman (Robert Alexander Farrar Thurman), a professor and academic who is one of the nation's foremost Buddhist scholars. Uma's mother was born in Mexico City, Mexico, to a German father and a Swedish mother (who herself was of Swedish, Danish, and German descent). Uma's father, a New Yorker, has English, Scots-Irish, Scottish, and German ancestry. Uma grew up in Amherst, Massachusetts, where her father worked at Amherst College.Thurman's household was one in which the The Dalai Lama was an occasional guest; she and her siblings all have names deriving from Buddhist mythology; and Middle American behavior was little understood, much less pursued. And so it was that the young Thurman confronted childhood with an odd name and eccentric home life -- and nature seemingly conspired against her as well. She is six feet tall, and from an early age towered over everyone else in class. Her famously large feet would soon sprout to size 11 -- and even beyond that -- and although they would eventually be lovingly filmed by director Quentin Tarantino, as a child she generally wore the biggest shoes in class, which only provided another subject of ridicule. Even her long nose moved one of her mother's friends to helpfully suggest rhinoplasty -- to the ten-year-old Thurman. To make matters worse yet, the family constantly relocated, making the gangly, socially inept Thurman perpetually the new kid in class. The result was an exceptionally awkward, self-conscious, lonely and alienated childhood.Unsurprisingly, the young Thurman enjoyed making believe she was someone other than herself, and so thrived at acting in school plays -- her sole successful extracurricular activity. This interest, and her lanky frame, perfect for modeling, led the 15-year-old Thurman to New York City for high school and modeling work (including a layout in Glamour Magazine) as she sought acting roles. The roles soon came, starting with a few formulaic and forgettable Hollywood products, but immediately followed by Terry Gilliam's As Aventuras do Bar\u00e3o Munchausen (1988) and Stephen Frears' Liga\u00e7\u00f5es Perigosas (1988), both of which brought much attention to her unorthodox sensuality and performances that intriguingly combined innocence and worldliness. The weird, gangly girl became a sex symbol virtually overnight.Thurman continued to be offered good roles in Hollywood pictures into the early '90s, the least commercially successful but probably best-known of which was her smoldering, astonishingly-adult performance as June, Henry Miller's wife, in Henry & June: Del\u00edrios Er\u00f3ticos (1990), the first movie to actually receive the dreaded NC-17 rating in the USA. After a celebrated start, Thurman's career stalled in the early '90s with movies such as the mediocre Uma Mulher Para Dois (1993). Worse, her first starring role was in At\u00e9 as Vaqueiras Ficam Tristes (1993), which had endured a tortured journey from cult-favorite book to big-budget movie, and was a critical and financial debacle. Fortunately, Uma bounced back with a brilliant performance as Mia Wallace, that most unorthodox of all gangster's molls, in Tarantino's lauded, hugely successful Pulp Fiction: Tempo de Viol\u00eancia (1994), a role for which Thurman received an Academy Award nomination.Since then, Thurman has had periods of flirting with roles in arty independents such as Um Encontro Para Sempre (1995), and supporting roles in which she has lent some glamorous presence to a mixed batch of movies, such as Brincando de Seduzir (1996) and Feito C\u00e3es e Gatos (1996). Thurman returned to smaller films after playing the villainess Poison Ivy in the reviled Joel Schumacher effort Batman & Robin (1997) and Emma Peel in a remake of Os Vingadores (1998). She worked with Woody Allen and Sean Penn on Poucas e Boas (1999), and starred in Richard Linklater's drama Amargo Reencontro (2001) opposite Hawke. Thurman also won a Golden Globe award for her turn in the made-for-television film Hysterical Blindness (2002), directed by Mira Nair.A return to the mainstream spotlight came when Thurman re-teamed with Quentin Tarantino for Kill Bill: Volume 1 (2003), a revenge flick the two had dreamed up on the set of Pulp Fiction: Tempo de Viol\u00eancia (1994). She also turned up in the John Woo cautioner O Pagamento (2003) that same year. The renewed attention was not altogether welcome because Thurman was dealing with the break-up of her marriage with Hawke at about this time. Thurman handled the situation with grace, however, and took her surging popularity in stride. She garnered critical acclaim for her work in Kill Bill: Volume 2 (2004) and was hailed as Tarantino's muse. Thurman reunited with Pulp Fiction: Tempo de Viol\u00eancia (1994) dance partner John Travolta for the O Nome do Jogo (1995) sequel Be Cool: O Outro Nome do Jogo (2005) and played Ulla in Os Produtores (2005).Thurman had been briefly married to Gary Oldman, from 1990 to 1992. In 1998, she married Ethan Hawke, her co-star in the offbeat futuristic thriller Gattaca, uma Experi\u00eancia Gen\u00e9tica (1997). The couple had two children, Levon and Maya. Hawke and Thurman filed for divorce in 2004.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Azure_Girl and Larry- 15\n          \n\n", "realName": "Uma Karuna Thurman", "height": "181"},

Jackson is an American producer and highly prolific actor, having appeared in over 100 films, including Duro de Matar 3: A Vingan\u00e7a (1995), Corpo Fechado (2000), Shaft (2000), Baladas, Rachas e um Louco de Kilt (2001), Entre o C\u00e9u e o Inferno (2006), Serpentes a Bordo (2006), and the Star Wars prequel trilogy (1999-2005), as well as the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Samuel Leroy Jackson was born in Washington, D.C., to Elizabeth (Montgomery) and Roy Henry Jackson. He was raised by his mother, a factory worker, and his grandparents. At Morehouse College, Jackson was active in the black student movement. In the seventies, he joined the Negro Ensemble Company (together with Morgan Freeman). In the eighties, he became well-known after three movies made by Spike Lee: Fa\u00e7a a Coisa Certa (1989), Mais e Melhores Blues (1990) and Febre da Selva (1991). He achieved prominence and critical acclaim in the early 1990s with films such as Jogos Patri\u00f3ticos (1992), N\u00e3o Chame a Pol\u00edcia! (1993), Amor \u00e0 Queima Roupa (1993), Jurassic Park: O Parque dos Dinossauros (1993), and his collaborations with director Quentin Tarantino, including Pulp Fiction: Tempo de Viol\u00eancia (1994), Jackie Brown (1997), and later Django Livre (2012). Going from supporting player to leading man, his performance in Pulp Fiction: Tempo de Viol\u00eancia (1994) gave him an Oscar nomination for his character Jules Winnfield, and he received a Silver Berlin Bear for his part as Ordell Robbi in Jackie Brown (1997). Jackson usually played bad guys and drug addicts before becoming an action hero, co-starring with Bruce Willis in Duro de Matar 3: A Vingan\u00e7a (1995) and Geena Davis in Despertar de um Pesadelo (1996).With Jackson's permission, his likeness was used for the Ultimate version of the Marvel Comics character, Nick Fury. He later did a cameo as the character in a post-credits scene from Homem de Ferro (2008), and went on to sign a nine-film commitment to reprise this role in future films, including major roles in Homem de Ferro 2 (2010), The Avengers: Os Vingadores (2012), Capit\u00e3o Am\u00e9rica 2: O Soldado Invernal (2014) and Vingadores: Era de Ultron (2015) and minor roles in Thor (2011) and Capit\u00e3o Am\u00e9rica: O Primeiro Vingador (2011). He has also portrayed the character in the second and final episodes of the first season of the TV show, Marvel's Agentes da S.H.I.E.L.D. da Marvel (2013). He has provided his voice to several animated films, television series and video games, including the roles of Lucius Best / Frozone in Pixar's film Os Incr\u00edveis (2004), Mace Windu in Star Wars: A Guerra dos Clones (2008), Afro Samurai in the anime television series Afro Samurai (2007), and Frank Tenpenny in the video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (2004).\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            wladimir van Heemst and Pedro Borges\n          \n\n", "realName": "Samuel Leroy Jackson", "height": "189"},

Collectively, he has appeared in films that have grossed in excess of $2.5 billion USD, placing him in the top ten stars in terms of box office receipts.Walter Bruce Willis was born on March 19, 1955, in Idar-Oberstein, West Germany, to a German mother, Marlene Kassel, and an American father, David Andrew Willis (from Carneys Point, New Jersey), who were then living on a United States military base. His family moved to the U.S. shortly after he was born, and he was raised in Penns Grove, New Jersey, where his mother worked at a bank and his father was a welder and factory worker. Willis picked up an interest for the dramatic arts in high school, and was allegedly \"discovered\" whilst working in a caf\u00e9 in New York City and then appeared in a couple of off-Broadway productions. While bartending one night, he was seen by a casting director who liked his personality and needed a bartender for a small movie role.After countless auditions, Willis contributed minor film appearances, usually uncredited, before landing the role of private eye \"David Addison\" alongside sultry Cybill Shepherd in the hit romantic comedy television series A Gata e o Rato (1985). His sarcastic and wisecracking P.I. is seen by some as a dry run for the role of hard-boiled NYC detective \"John McClane\" in the monster hit Duro de Matar (1988), in which Willis' character single-handedly battled a gang of ruthless international thieves in a Los Angeles skyscraper. He reprised the role of McClane in the sequel, Duro de Matar 2 (1990), set at a snowbound Washington's Dulles International Airport as a group of renegade Special Forces soldiers seek to repatriate a corrupt South American general. Excellent box office returns demanded a further sequel Duro de Matar 3: A Vingan\u00e7a (1995), this time co-starring Samuel L. Jackson as a cynical Harlem shop owner unwittingly thrust into assisting McClane during a terrorist bombing campaign on a sweltering day in New York.Willis found time out from all the action mayhem to provide the voice of \"Mikey\" the baby in the very popular family comedies Olha Quem Est\u00e1 Falando (1989), and its sequel Olha Quem Est\u00e1 Falando Tamb\u00e9m (1990) also starring John Travolta and Kirstie Alley. Over the next decade, Willis starred in some very successful films, some very offbeat films and some unfortunate box office flops. A Fogueira das Vaidades (1990) and Hudson Hawk, o Falc\u00e3o Est\u00e1 \u00e0 Solta (1991) were both large scale financial disasters that were savaged by the critics, and both are arguably best left off the CVs of all the actors involved, however Willis was still popular with movie audiences and selling plenty of theatre tickets with the hyper-violent O \u00daltimo Boy Scout (1991), the darkly humored A Morte lhe Cai Bem (1992) and the mediocre police thriller Zona de Perigo (1993).During the 1990s, Willis also appeared in several independent and low budget productions that won him new fans and praise from the critics for his intriguing performances working with some very diverse film directors. He appeared in the oddly appealing O Anjo da Guarda (1994), as a cagey prizefighter in the Quentin Tarantino directed mega-hit Pulp Fiction: Tempo de Viol\u00eancia (1994), the Terry Gilliam directed apocalyptic thriller Os 12 Macacos (1995), the Luc Besson directed sci-fi opus O Quinto Elemento (1997) and the M. Night Shyamalan directed spine-tingling epic O Sexto Sentido (1999).Willis next starred in the gangster comedy Meu Vizinho Mafioso (2000), worked again with \"hot\" director M. Night Shyamalan in the less than gripping Corpo Fechado (2000), and in two military dramas, A Guerra de Hart (2002) and L\u00e1grimas do Sol (2003) that both failed to really fire with movie audiences or critics alike. However, Willis bounced back into the spotlight in the critically applauded Frank Miller graphic novel turned movie Sin City: A Cidade do Pecado (2005), the voice of \"RJ\" the scheming raccoon in the animated hit Os Sem-Floresta (2006) and \"Die Hard\" fans rejoiced to see \"John McClane\" return to the big screen in the high tech Duro de Matar 4.0 (2007) aka \"Die Hard 4.0\".Willis was married to actress Demi Moore for approximately thirteen years and they share custody to their three daughters.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            firehouse44@hotmail.com\n          \n\n", "realName": "Walter Bruce Willis", "height": "183"},

His father, Tony Tarantino, is an Italian-American actor and musician from New York, and his mother, Connie (McHugh), is a nurse from Tennessee. Quentin moved with his mother to Torrance, California, when he was four years old.In January of 1992, first-time writer-director Tarantino's C\u00e3es de Aluguel (1992) appeared at the Sundance Film Festival. The film garnered critical acclaim and the director became a legend immediately. Two years later, he followed up Dogs success with Pulp Fiction: Tempo de Viol\u00eancia (1994) which premiered at the Cannes film festival, winning the coveted Palme D'Or Award. At the 1995 Academy Awards, it was nominated for the best picture, best director and best original screenplay. Tarantino and writing partner Roger Avary came away with the award only for best original screenplay. In 1995, Tarantino directed one fourth of the anthology Grande Hotel (1995) with friends and fellow auteurs Alexandre Rockwell, Robert Rodriguez and Allison Anders. The film opened December 25 in the United States to very weak reviews. Tarantino's next film was Um Drink no Inferno (1996), a vampire/crime story which he wrote and co-starred with George Clooney. The film did fairly well theatrically.Since then, Tarantino has helmed several critically and financially successful films, including Jackie Brown (1997), Kill Bill: Volume 1 (2003), Kill Bill: Volume 2 (2004), Bastardos Ingl\u00f3rios (2009), Django Livre (2012) and Os Oito Odiados (2015).\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Kale Whorton <nikko11@mind.net>\n          \n\n", "realName": "Quentin Jerome Tarantino", "height": "185"},

He had a comfortable, middle-class upbringing in nearby Piedmont. At school Clint took interest in music and mechanics, but was an otherwise bored student; this resulted in being held back a grade. Eastwood's parents relocated to Washington state in 1949, and Clint worked menial jobs in the Pacific Northwest until returning to California for a stint at Fort Ord Military Reservation. He enrolled at Los Angeles City College, but dropped out after two semesters to pursue acting. During the mid-'50s he found uncredited bit parts in such B-films as A Revanche do Monstro (1955) and Tar\u00e2ntula! (1955) while simultaneously digging swimming pools to supplement his income. In 1958, he landed his first consequential acting role in the long-running TV show Rawhide (1959) with Eric Fleming. Though only a secondary player for the first seven seasons, Clint was promoted to series star when Fleming departed in its final year, along the way becoming a recognizable face to television viewers around the country.Eastwood's big-screen breakthrough came as The Man with No Name in Sergio Leone's trilogy of excellent spaghetti westerns: Por Um Punhado de D\u00f3lares (1964), Por uns D\u00f3lares a Mais (1965), and Tr\u00eas Homens em Conflito (1966). The movies were shown exclusively in Italy during their respective copyright years with Enrico Maria Salerno providing the voice for Clint's character, finally getting American distribution in 1967. As the last film racked up phenomenal grosses, Eastwood, 37, rose from undistinguished TV actor to sought-after box office attraction in just a matter of months. Yet again a success was the late-blooming star's first U.S.-made western, A Marca da Forca (1968). He followed that up with the lead role in Meu Nome \u00e9 Coogan (1968) (the loose inspiration for the TV series McCloud (1970)), before playing second fiddle to Richard Burton in the World War II epic O Desafio das \u00c1guias (1968) and Lee Marvin in the bizarre musical Os Aventureiros do Ouro (1969). In Os Abutres T\u00eam Fome (1970) and Os Guerreiros Pilantras (1970), Eastwood leaned in an experimental direction by combining tough-guy action with offbeat humor.1971 proved to be his busiest year in film. He starred as a predatory Union soldier in O Estranho que N\u00f3s Amamos (1971) to critical acclaim, and made his directorial debut with the classic erotic thriller Perversa Paix\u00e3o (1971). His role as the hard edge police inspector in Perseguidor Implac\u00e1vel (1971), meanwhile, boosted him to cultural icon status and helped popularize the loose-cannon cop genre. Thereafter, Eastwood put out a steady stream of entertaining movies: the westerns Joe Kidd (1972), O Estranho sem Nome (1973) and Josey Wales, o Fora da Lei (1976) (his first of six onscreen collaborations with then live-in love Sondra Locke), the Dirty Harry sequels Magnum 44 (1973) and Sem Medo da Morte (1976), the road adventures O \u00daltimo Golpe (1974) and Rota Suicida (1977), and the fact-based prison film Alcatraz: Fuga Imposs\u00edvel (1979). He branched out into the comedy genre in 1978 with Doido para Brigar... Louco para Amar (1978), which became the biggest hit of his career up to that time; taking inflation into account, it still is. In short, Escalado para Morrer (1975) notwithstanding, the '70s were an uninterrupted success for Clint.Eastwood kicked off the '80s with Punhos de A\u00e7o: Um Lutador de Rua (1980), the blockbuster sequel to Every Which Way But Loose. The fourth Dirty Harry film, Impacto Fulminante (1983), was the highest-grossing film of the franchise and spawned his trademark catchphrase, \"Make my day.\" Clint also starred in Bronco Billy (1980), Raposa de Fogo (1982), Um Agente na Corda Bamba (1984), Cidade Ardente (1984), O Cavaleiro Solit\u00e1rio (1985) and O Destemido Senhor da Guerra (1986), all of which were solid hits, with Honkytonk Man - A \u00daltima Can\u00e7\u00e3o (1982) being his only commercial failure of the period. In 1988 he did his fifth and final Dirty Harry movie, Dirty Harry na Lista Negra (1988). Although it was a success overall, it did not have the box office punch the previous films had. About this time, with outright bombs Cadillac Cor-de-Rosa (1989) and Rookie: Um Profissional do Perigo (1990), it seemed Eastwood's star was declining as it never had before. He started taking on low-key projects, directing Bird (1988), a biopic of Charlie Parker that earned him a Golden Globe, and starring in and directing Cora\u00e7\u00e3o de Ca\u00e7ador (1990), an uneven, loose biopic of John Huston. (Both films had a limited release.)Eastwood bounced back with his dark western Os Imperdo\u00e1veis (1992), which garnered the then 62-year-old his first ever Academy Award nomination (Best Actor), and an Oscar win for Best Director. Churning out a quick follow-up hit, he took on the secret service in Na Linha de Fogo (1993), then accepted second billing for the first time since 1970 in the interesting but poorly received Um Mundo Perfeito (1993) with Kevin Costner. Next up was a love story, As Pontes de Madison (1995), where Clint surprised audiences with a sensitive performance alongside none other than Meryl Streep. But it soon became apparent he was going backwards after his brief revival. Subsequent films were credible, but nothing really stuck out. Poder Absoluto (1997) and Cowboys do Espa\u00e7o (2000) did well enough, while Crime Verdadeiro (1999) and D\u00edvida de Sangue (2002) were received badly, as was Meia-Noite no Jardim do Bem e do Mal (1997), which he directed but didn't appear in.Eastwood surprised yet again in the mid-'00s, when he returned to the top of the A-list with Menina de Ouro (2004). Also starring Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman, the hugely successful drama won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director for Clint. He scored his second Best Actor nomination, too. Eastwood's next starring vehicle, Gran Torino (2008), earned almost $30 million in its opening weekend and was his highest grosser unadjusted for inflation. 2012 saw him in a rare lighthearted movie, Curvas da Vida (2012), as well as a reality show, Mrs. Eastwood & Company (2012). Between screen appearances, Clint chalked up an impressive list of credits behind the camera. He directed Sobre Meninos e Lobos (2003) (in which Sean Penn and Tim Robbins gave Oscar-winning performances), A Conquista da Honra (2006), Cartas de Iwo Jima (2006) (nominated for the Best Picture Oscar), A Troca (2008) (a vehicle for screen megastar Angelina Jolie), Invictus (2009) (again with Freeman), Al\u00e9m da Vida (2010), J. Edgar (2011), Jersey Boys: Em Busca da M\u00fasica (2014), Sniper Americano (2014) (2014's top box office champ), Sully: O Her\u00f3i do Rio Hudson (2016) (starring Tom Hanks as hero pilot Chesley Sullenberger) and 15h17: Trem Para Paris (2018) (based on the thwarted Thalys train attack of 2015). His latest project, in which he stars as an unlikely drug courier, is A Mula (2018), and after that he'll direct O Caso Richard Jewell (2019).Outside of work, Eastwood has led an extremely convoluted existence. He managed to keep his personal life top secret for the first three decades of his celebrity. Even to this day, the Hollywood kingpin refuses to disclose just exactly how many families he's started. He had a long time relationship with frequent '70s/'80s co-star Locke (deceased 2018), who published a scathing memoir in 1997, and has fathered at least eight children by at least six different women in an unending string of liaisons, many of which overlapped. He has been married only twice, however -- with a mere three of his progeny coming from those unions. Clint Eastwood lives in L.A. and owns additional properties in Carmel, the Bay Area, Burney (in northern California), Idaho's Sun Valley and Maui, Hawaii.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Scott- msa0510@mail.ecu.edu\n          \n\n", "realName": "Clinton Eastwood Jr.", "height": "193"},

His parents, Bertha (Schorr) and Abraham Wallach, owned a candy store, Bertha's Candy Store. He went on to graduate with a B.A. from the University of Texas in Austin, but gained his dramatic training with the Actors Studio and the Neighborhood Playhouse. He made his debut on Broadway in 1945, and won a Tony Award in 1951 for portraying Alvaro Mangiacavallo in the Tennessee Williams play \"The Rose Tattoo\".Wallach made a strong screen debut in 1956 in the film version of the Tennessee Williams play Boneca de Carne (1956), shined as \"Dancer\", the nattily dressed hitman, in director Don Siegel's film-noir classic O S\u00e1dico Selvagem (1958), and co-starred in the heist film Sete Ladr\u00f5es (1960). Director John Sturges then cast Wallach as vicious Mexican bandit Calvera in Sete Homens e um Destino (1960), the western adaptation of the Akira Kurosawa epic Os Sete Samurais (1954). Os Desajustados (1961), in the star-spangled western opus A Conquista do Oeste (1962), the underrated WW2 film Os Vitoriosos (1963), as a kidnapper in O Segredo das Esmeraldas Negras (1964), in the sea epic Lord Jim (1965) and in the romantic comedy Como Roubar um Milh\u00e3o de D\u00f3lares (1966).Looking for a third lead actor in the final episode of the \"Dollars Trilogy\", Italian director Sergio Leone cast the versatile Wallach as the lying, two-faced, money-hungry (but somehow lovable) bandit \"Tuco\" in the spectacular Tr\u00eas Homens em Conflito (1966) (aka \"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly\"), arguably his most memorable performance. Wallach kept busy throughout the remainder of the '60s and into the '70s with good roles in O Ouro de Mackenna (1969), Licen\u00e7a Para Amar At\u00e9 a Meia-Noite (1973), Crazy Joe (1974), O Fundo do Mar (1977) and as Steve McQueen's bail buddy in Ca\u00e7ador Implac\u00e1vel (1980).The 1980s was an interesting period for Wallach, as he was regularly cast as an aging doctor, a Mafia figure or an over-the-hill hitman, such as in A Can\u00e7\u00e3o do Carrasco (1982), Our Family Honor (1985), Os \u00daltimos Dur\u00f5es (1986), Querem me Enlouquecer (1987), A Chave do Enigma (1990) and as the candy-addicted \"Don Altabello\" in O Poderoso Chef\u00e3o III (1990). At 75+ years of age, Wallach's quality of work was still first class and into the 1990s and beyond, he has remained in demand. He lent fine support to Vendetta: Secrets of a Mafia Bride (1990), Trai\u00e7\u00e3o e Poder: A Hist\u00f3ria de Jackie Presser (1992), Cidade Nua: Justi\u00e7a \u00c1 Bala (1998) and Tenha F\u00e9 (2000). Most recently Wallach showed up as a fast-talking liquor store owner in Sobre Meninos e Lobos (2003) and in the comedic drama O Rei do Peda\u00e7o (2004).In early 2005, Eli Wallach released his much anticipated autobiography, \"The Good, The Bad And Me: In My Anecdotage\", an enjoyable reading from one of the screen's most inventive and enduring actors.Eli Wallach was very much a family man who remained married to his wife Anne Jackson for 66 years. When Wallach died at 98, in 2014, in Manhattan, NY, he was survived by his wife, three children, five grandchildren and several great-grandchildren.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            firehouse44@hotmail.com\n          \n\n", "realName": "Eli Herschel Wallach", "height": "170"},

Van Cleef started out as an accountant. He served in the U.S. Navy aboard minesweepers and sub chasers during World War II. After the war he worked as an office administrator, becoming involved in amateur theatrics in his spare time. An audition for a professional role led to a touring company job in \"Mr. Roberts\". His performance was seen by Stanley Kramer, who cast him as henchman Jack Colby in Matar ou Morrer (1952), a role that brought him great recognition despite the fact that he had no dialogue. For the next decade he played a string of memorably villainous characters, primarily in westerns but also in crime dramas such as Imp\u00e9rio do Crime (1955). His hawk nose and steely, slit eyes seemed destined to keep him always in the realm of heavies, but in the mid 1960s Sergio Leone cast him as the tough but decent Col.

A new career as a western hero (or at least anti-hero) opened up, and Van Cleef became an international star, though in films of decreasing quality.

Vincenzo Leone), one of Italy's cinema pioneers, and actress Bice Valerian. Leone entered films in his late teens, working as an assistant director to both Italian directors and U.S. directors working in Italy (usually making Biblical and Roman epics, much in vogue at the time). Towards the end of the 1950s he started writing screenplays, and began directing after taking over Os \u00daltimos Dias de Pomp\u00e9ia (1959) in mid-shoot after its original director fell ill. His first solo feature, O Colosso de Rodes (1961), was a routine Roman epic, but his second feature, Por Um Punhado de D\u00f3lares (1964), a shameless remake of Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo, o Guarda-Costas (1961), caused a revolution. Although it wasn't the first spaghetti Western, it was far and away the most successful, and shot former T.V. cowboy Clint Eastwood to stardom (Leone wanted Henry Fonda or Charles Bronson but couldn't afford them). The two sequels, Por uns D\u00f3lares a Mais (1965) and Tr\u00eas Homens em Conflito (1966), were shot on much higher budgets and were even more successful, though his masterpiece, Era uma Vez no Oeste (1968), in which Leone finally worked with Fonda and Bronson, was mutilated by Paramount Pictures and flopped at the U.S. box office. He directed Quando Explode a Vingan\u00e7a (1971) reluctantly, and turned down offers to direct O Poderoso Chef\u00e3o (1972) in favor of his dream project, which became Era uma Vez na Am\u00e9rica (1984). He died in 1989 after preparing an even more expensive Soviet coproduction on the World War II siege of Leningrad.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Michael Brooke < michael@everyman.demon.co.uk>\n          \n\n", "realName": null, "height": "170"},

However, his portrayals of Billy Beane in O Homem Que Mudou o Jogo (2011), and Rusty Ryan in the remake of Onze Homens e um Segredo (2001) and its sequels, also loom large in his filmography.Pitt was born William Bradley Pitt on December 18th, 1963, in Shawnee, Oklahoma, and was raised in Springfield, Missouri. He is the son of Jane Etta (Hillhouse), a school counselor, and William Alvin Pitt, a truck company manager. He has a younger brother, Douglas (Doug) Pitt, and a younger sister, Julie Neal Pitt. At Kickapoo High School, Pitt was involved in sports, debating, student government and school musicals. Pitt attended the University of Missouri, where he majored in journalism with a focus on advertising. He occasionally acted in fraternity shows. He left college two credits short of graduating to move to California. Before he became successful at acting, Pitt supported himself by driving strippers in limos, moving refrigerators and dressing as a giant chicken while working for \"el Pollo Loco\".Pitt's earliest credited roles were in television, starting on the daytime soap opera Another World (1964) before appearing in the recurring role of Randy on the legendary prime time soap opera Dallas (1978). Following a string of guest appearances on various television series through the 1980s, Pitt gained widespread attention with a small part in Thelma & Louise (1991), in which he played a sexy criminal who romanced and conned Geena Davis. This lead to starring roles in badly received films such as Johnny Suede (1991) and Mundo Proibido (1992).But Pitt's career hit an upswing with his casting in Nada \u00e9 para Sempre (1992), which cemented his status as an multi-layered actor as opposed to just a pretty face. Pitt's subsequent projects were as quirky and varied in tone as his performances, ranging from his unforgettably comic cameo as stoner roommate Floyd in Amor \u00e0 Queima Roupa (1993) to romantic roles in such visually lavish films as Entrevista com o Vampiro (1994) and Lendas da Paix\u00e3o (1994), to an emotionally tortured detective in the horror-thriller Seven: Os Sete Crimes Capitais (1995). His portrayal of frenetic oddball Jeffrey Goines in Os 12 Macacos (1995) won him a Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role.Pitt's portrayal of Achilles in the big-budget period drama Tr\u00f3ia (2004) helped establish his appeal as action star and was closely followed by a co-starring role in the stylish spy-versus-spy flick Sr. & Sra. Smith (2005). It was on the set of Mr. & Mrs. Smith that Pitt, who married Jennifer Aniston in a highly publicized ceremony in 2000, met his current partner Angelina Jolie. Pitt left Aniston for Jolie in 2005, a break-up that continues to fuel tabloid stories years after its occurrence.He continues to wildly vary his film choices, appearing in everything from high-concept popcorn flicks such as Megamente (2010) to adventurous critic-bait like Bastardos Ingl\u00f3rios (2009) and A \u00c1rvore da Vida (2011). He has received two Best Actor Oscar nominations, for O Curioso Caso de Benjamin Button (2008) and O Homem Que Mudou o Jogo (2011). In 2014, he starred in the war film Cora\u00e7\u00f5es de Ferro (2014), opposite Shia LaBeouf, Logan Lerman, Jon Bernthal, and Michael Pe\u00f1a.Pitt and Jolie have six children, including two sons and a daughter who were adopted.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Anonymous and JJH\n          \n\n", "realName": "William Bradley Pitt", "height": "180"},

He attended theater schools throughout his life, and eventually managed to find work on stage in New York as a member of the Signature players, who produced the works of playwright and director Edward Albee. Around the time when he was appearing in Albee's Fragments, in Hollywood, they were looking for a young actor to star opposite Richard Gere in a new courtroom thriller, As Duas Faces de um Crime (1996).

Gere was on the verge of walking away from the project, fed up with the wait for a young star to be found, when Edward auditioned and won the role over 2000 other hopefuls. Before the film was even released, his test screenings for the part were causing a Hollywood sensation, and he was soon offered roles in Woody Allen's Todos Dizem Eu Te Amo (1996) and O Povo Contra Larry Flint (1996). Edward won the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Supporting Role and received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in As Duas Faces de um Crime (1996). In 1998, Norton gained 30 pounds of muscle and transformed his look into that of a monstrous skinhead for his role as a violent white supremacist in A Outra Hist\u00f3ria Americana (1998).

He attended RADA in London and appeared in a number of West End stage productions including RSC's \"Fair Maid of the West\" (Spencer), (1986) and \"Romeo and Juliet\" (1987) (Romeo) , as well as \"Deathwatch\" (Lederer) (1985) at the Young Vic and \"Killing the Cat\" (Danny) (1990) at the Theatre Upstairs.This soulful, green-eyed blonde's roles are so varied that his magnetic persona convincing plays angst-ridden villains, as in Clarissa (1991), passionate lovers like Mellors in O Amante de Lady Chatterley (1993), rough-and-ready soldiers such as Richard Sharpe, heart wrenching warriors as the emotionally torn Boromir in \"The Lord of the Rings,\" and noble Greeks, like Odysseus in Tr\u00f3ia (2004), where his very presence in the film adds grace and validity to the rest of the movie.

His mother's family, originally surnamed \"Fraga\", was entirely Portuguese, while his father was of mostly English ancestry. Tom grew up in what he has called a \"fractured\" family. He moved around a great deal after his parents' divorce, living with a succession of step-families. No problems, no alcoholism - just a confused childhood. He has no acting experience in college and credits the fact that he could not get cast in a college play with actually starting his career. He went downtown, and auditioned for a community theater play, was invited by the director of that play to go to Cleveland, and there his acting career started.Ron Howard was working on Splash: Uma Sereia em Minha Vida (1984), a fantasy-comedy about a mermaid who falls in love with a business executive. Howard considered Hanks for the role of the main character's wisecracking brother, which eventually went to John Candy. Instead, Hanks landed the lead role and the film went on to become a surprise box office success, grossing more than $69 million. After several flops and a moderate success with the comedy Dragnet: Desafiando o Perigo (1987), Hanks' stature in the film industry rose. The broad success with the fantasy-comedy Quero ser Grande (1988) established him as a major Hollywood talent, both as a box office draw and within the film industry as an actor. For his performance in the film, Hanks earned his first Academy Award nomination as Best Actor.Hanks climbed back to the top again with his portrayal of a washed-up baseball legend turned manager in Uma Equipe Muito Especial (1992). Hanks has stated that his acting in earlier roles was not great, but that he subsequently improved. In an interview with Vanity Fair, Hanks noted his \"modern era of movie making ... because enough self-discovery has gone on ... My work has become less pretentiously fake and over the top\". This \"modern era\" began for Hanks, first with Sintonia de Amor (1993) and then with Filad\u00e9lfia (1993). The former was a blockbuster success about a widower who finds true love over the radio airwaves. Richard Schickel of Time magazine called his performance \"charming\", and most critics agreed that Hanks' portrayal ensured him a place among the premier romantic-comedy stars of his generation.In Philadelphia, he played a gay lawyer with AIDS who sues his firm for discrimination. Hanks lost 35 pounds and thinned his hair in order to appear sickly for the role. In a review for People, Leah Rozen stated, \"Above all, credit for Philadelphia's success belongs to Hanks, who makes sure that he plays a character, not a saint. He is flat-out terrific, giving a deeply felt, carefully nuanced performance that deserves an Oscar.\" Hanks won the 1993 Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in Philadelphia. During his acceptance speech, he revealed that his high school drama teacher Rawley Farnsworth and former classmate John Gilkerson, two people with whom he was close, were gay.Hanks followed Philadelphia with the blockbuster Forrest Gump: O Contador de Hist\u00f3rias (1994) which grossed a worldwide total of over $600 million at the box office. Hanks remarked: \"When I read the script for Gump, I saw it as one of those kind of grand, hopeful movies that the audience can go to and feel ... some hope for their lot and their position in life ... I got that from the movies a hundred million times when I was a kid. I still do.\" Hanks won his second Best Actor Academy Award for his role in Forrest Gump, becoming only the second actor to have accomplished the feat of winning consecutive Best Actor Oscars.Hanks' next role - astronaut and commander Jim Lovell, in the docudrama Apollo 13: Do Desastre ao Triunfo (1995) - reunited him with Ron Howard. Critics generally applauded the film and the performances of the entire cast, which included actors Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, and Kathleen Quinlan. The movie also earned nine Academy Award nominations, winning two. Later that year, Hanks starred in Disney/Pixar's computer-animated film Toy Story (1995), as the voice of Sheriff Woody. A year later, he made his directing debut with the musical comedy The Wonders: O Sonho N\u00e3o Acabou (1996) about the rise and fall of a 1960s pop group, also playing the role of a music producer.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Pedro Borges\n          \n\n", "realName": "Thomas Jeffrey Hanks", "height": "183"},

DiCaprio has gone from relatively humble beginnings, as a supporting cast member of the sitcom Tudo em Fam\u00edlia (1985) and low budget horror movies, such as Criaturas 3 (1991), to a major teenage heartthrob in the 1990s, as the hunky lead actor in movies such as Romeu + Julieta (1996) and Titanic (1997), to then become a leading man in Hollywood blockbusters, made by internationally renowned directors such as Martin Scorsese and Christopher Nolan.Leonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio was born November 11, 1974 in Los Angeles, California, the only child of Irmelin DiCaprio (n\u00e9e Indenbirken) and former comic book artist George DiCaprio. His father is of Italian and German descent, and his mother, who is German-born, is of German and Russian ancestry. His middle name, \"Wilhelm\", was his maternal grandfather's first name. Leonardo's father had achieved minor status as an artist and distributor of cult comic book titles, and was even depicted in several issues of American Splendor, the cult semi-autobiographical comic book series by the late 'Harvey Pekar', a friend of George's. Leonardo's performance skills became obvious to his parents early on, and after signing him up with a talent agent who wanted Leonardo to perform under the stage name \"Lenny Williams\", DiCaprio began appearing on a number of television commercials and educational programs.DiCaprio began attracting the attention of producers, who cast him in small roles in a number of television series, such as Roseanne (1988) and The New Lassie (1989), but it wasn't until 1991 that DiCaprio made his film debut in Criaturas 3 (1991), a low-budget horror movie. While Criaturas 3 (1991) did little to help showcase DiCaprio's acting abilities, it did help him develop his show-reel, and attract the attention of the people behind the hit sitcom Tudo em Fam\u00edlia (1985), in which Leonardo was cast in the \"Cousin Oliver\" role of a young homeless boy who moves in with the Seavers. While DiCaprio's stint on Tudo em Fam\u00edlia (1985) was very short, as the sitcom was axed the year after he joined, it helped bring DiCaprio into the public's attention and, after the sitcom ended, DiCaprio began auditioning for roles in which he would get the chance to prove his acting chops.Leonardo took up a diverse range of roles in the early 1990s, including a mentally challenged youth in Gilbert Grape: Aprendiz de Sonhador (1993), a young gunslinger in R\u00e1pida e Mortal (1995) and a drug addict in one of his most challenging roles to date, Jim Carroll in Di\u00e1rio de um Adolescente (1995), a role which the late River Phoenix originally expressed interest in. While these diverse roles helped establish Leonardo's reputation as an actor, it wasn't until his role as Romeo Montague in Baz Luhrmann's Romeu + Julieta (1996) that Leonardo became a household name, a true movie star. The following year, DiCaprio starred in another movie about doomed lovers, Titanic (1997), which went on to beat all box office records held before then, as, at the time, Titanic (1997) became the highest grossing movie of all time, and cemented DiCaprio's reputation as a teen heartthrob. Following his work on Titanic (1997), DiCaprio kept a low profile for a number of years, with roles in O Homem da M\u00e1scara de Ferro (1998) and the low-budget A Praia (2000) being some of his few notable roles during this period.In 2002, he burst back into screens throughout the world with leading roles in Prenda-me se for Capaz (2002) and Gangues de Nova York (2002), his first of many collaborations with director Martin Scorsese. With a current salary of $20 million a movie, DiCaprio is now one of the biggest movie stars in the world. However, he has not limited his professional career to just acting in movies, as DiCaprio is a committed environmentalist, who is actively involved in many environmental causes, and his commitment to this issue led to his involvement in The 11th Hour, a documentary movie about the state of the natural environment. As someone who has gone from small roles in television commercials to one of the most respected actors in the world, DiCaprio has had one of the most diverse careers in cinema. DiCaprio continued to defy conventions about the types of roles he would accept, and with his career now seeing him leading all-star casts in action thrillers such as Os Infiltrados (2006), Ilha do Medo (2010) and Christopher Nolan's A Origem (2010), DiCaprio continues to wow audiences by refusing to conform to any clich\u00e9 about actors.In 2012, he played a mustache-twirling villain in Django Livre (2012), and then tragic literary character Jay Gatsby in O Grande Gatsby (2013) and Jordan Belfort in O Lobo de Wall Street (2013).DiCaprio is passionate about environmental and humanitarian causes, having donated $1,000,000 to earthquake relief efforts in 2010, the same year he contributed $1,000,000 to the Wildlife Conservation Society.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Pedro Borges\n          \n\n", "realName": "Leonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio", "height": "183"},

He eventually dropped out of school to pursue an acting career.After a few stage gigs and a handful of made-for-TV movies, he scored a supporting role in the Rob Lowe hockey flick Veia de Campe\u00e3o (1986), which was filmed in Canada. Shortly after the production wrapped, Reeves packed his bags and headed for Hollywood. Reeves popped up on critics' radar with his performance in the dark adolescent drama, Juventude Assassina (1986), and landed a supporting role in the Oscar-nominated Liga\u00e7\u00f5es Perigosas (1988) with director Stephen Frears.His first popular success was the role of totally rad dude Ted \"Theodore\" Logan in Bill & Ted: Uma Aventura Fant\u00e1stica (1989). The wacky time-travel movie became something of a cultural phenomenon, and audiences would forever confuse Reeves's real-life persona with that of his doofy on-screen counterpart. He then joined the casts of Ron Howard's comedy, O Tiro que n\u00e3o Saiu pela Culatra (1989) and Lawrence Kasdan's Te Amarei At\u00e9 te Matar (1990).Over the next few years, Reeves tried to shake the Ted stigma with a series of highbrow projects. He played a slumming rich boy opposite River Phoenix's narcoleptic male hustler in Garotos de Programa (1991), an unlucky lawyer who stumbles into the vampire's lair in Dr\u00e1cula de Bram Stoker (1992), and Shakespearean party-pooper Don John in Muito Barulho por Nada (1993).In 1994, the understated actor became a big-budget action star with the release of Velocidade M\u00e1xima (1994). Its success heralded an era of five years in which Reeves would alternate between small films, like Paix\u00e3o Bandida (1996) and Sem Limite (1997), and big films like Caminhando nas Nuvens (1995) and Advogado do Diabo (1997). (There were a couple misfires, too: Johnny Mnemonic, o Cyborg do Futuro (1995) and Rea\u00e7\u00e3o em Cadeia (1996).) After all this, Reeves did the unthinkable and passed on the Speed sequel, but he struck box-office gold again a few years later with the Wachowski siblings' cyberadventure, Matrix (1999).Now a bonafide box-office star, Keanu would appear in a string of smaller films -- among them Virando o Jogo (2000), O Observador (2000), O Dom da Premoni\u00e7\u00e3o (2000), Doce Novembro (2001), and Hardball - O Jogo da Vida (2001) - before Matrix Reloaded (2003) and Matrix Revolutions (2003) were both released in 2003.Since the end of The Matrix trilogy, Keanu has divided his time between mainstream and indie fare, landing hits with Algu\u00e9m tem que Ceder (2003), A Casa do Lago (2006), and Os Reis da Rua (2008). He's kept Matrix fans satiated with films such as Constantine (2005), O Homem Duplo (2006), and O Dia em que a Terra Parou (2008). And he's waded back into art-house territory with Ellie Parker (2005), Impulsividade (2005), A Vida \u00cdntima de Pippa Lee (2009), and A Ocasi\u00e3o Faz O Ladr\u00e3o (2010).Most recently, as post-production on the samurai epic 47 Ronins (2013) waged on, Keanu appeared in front of the camera in Lado a Lado (2012), a documentary on celluloid and digital filmmaking, which he also produced. He also directed another Asian-influenced project, O Homem do Tai Chi (2013).In 2014, Keanu played the title role in the action revenge film De Volta ao Jogo (2014), which became popular with critics and audiences alike. He reprised the role in John Wick: Um Novo Dia Para Matar (2017), taking the now-iconic character to a better opening weekend and even more enthusiastic reviews than the first go-around.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Anonymous\n          \n\n", "realName": "Keanu Charles Reeves", "height": "186"},

At the age of 10, he appeared in his first play, \"In My Many Names and Days,\" at a cramped little theater space in Manhattan. He continued on but managed to avoid the trappings of a child star per se, considering himself more a working child actor at the time. Billing himself as Larry Fishburne during this early phase, he never studied or was trained in the technique of acting. In 1973, at the age of 12, Laurence won a recurring role on the daytime soap One Life to Live (1968) that lasted three seasons and subsequently made his film debut in the ghetto-themed Cornbread, Earl and Me (1975). At 14 Francis Ford Coppola cast him in Apocalypse Now (1979), which filmed for two years in the Philippines. Laurence didn't work for another year and a half after that long episode. A graduate of Lincoln Square Academy, Coppola was impressed enough with Laurence to hire him again down the line with featured roles in O Selvagem da Motocicleta (1983), Cotton Club (1984), and Jardins de Pedra (1987).Throughout the 1980s, he continued to build up his film and TV credit list with featured roles despite little fanfare. A recurring role as Cowboy Curtis on the kiddie show Pee-wee's Playhouse (1986) helped him through whatever lean patches there were at the time. With the new decade (1990s) came out-and-out stardom for Laurence. A choice lead in John Singleton's urban tale Os Donos da Rua (1991) catapulted him immediately into the front of the film ranks. Set in LA's turbulent South Central area, his potent role as a morally minded divorced father who strives to rise above the ignorance and violence of his surroundings, Laurence showed true command and the ability to hold up any film. On stage, he would become invariably linked to playwright August Wilson and his 20th Century epic African-American experience after starring for two years as the eruptive ex-con in \"Two Training Running.\" For this powerful, mesmerizing performance, Laurence won nearly every prestigious theater award in the books (Tony, Outer Critics Circle, Drama Desk and Theatre World). It was around the time of this career hallmark that he began billing himself as \"Laurence\" instead of \"Larry.\" More awards and accolades came his way. In addition to an Emmy for the pilot episode of the series \"Tribeca,\" he was nominated for his fine work in the quality mini-movies Prova de Fogo (1995) and Miss Evers' Boys (1997).On the larger screen, both Laurence and Angela Bassett were given Oscar nominations for their raw, seething portrayals of rock stars Ike and Tina Turner in the film Tina - A Verdadeira Hist\u00f3ria de Tina Turner (1993). To his credit, he managed to take an extremely repellent character and make it a sobering and captivating experience. A pulp box-office favorite as well, he originated the role of Morpheus, Keanu Reeves' mentor, in the exceedingly popular futuristic sci-fi Matrix (1999), best known for its ground-breaking special effects. He wisely returned for its back-to-back sequels. Into the millennium, Laurence extended his talents by making his screenwriting and directorial debut in Once in the Life (2000), in which he also starred. The film is based on his own critically acclaimed play \"Riff Raff,\" which he staged five years earlier. In 1999, he scored a major theater triumph with a multi-racial version of \"The Lion in Winter\" as Henry II opposite Stockard Channing's Eleanor of Acquitaine. On film, Fishburne has appeared in a variety of interesting roles in not-always-successful films. Never less than compelling, a few of his more notable parts include an urban speed chess player in Lances Inocentes (1993); a military prisoner in Cadence - Compasso de Vida (1990); a college professor in Singleton's Duro Aprendizado (1995); a CIA operative in M\u00e1 Companhia (1995); the title role in Othello (1995) (he was the first black actor to play the part on film); a spaceship rescue team leader in the sci-fi horror O Enigma do Horizonte (1997); a Depression-era gangster in Homens Perigosos (1997); a dogged police sergeant in Clint Eastwood's Sobre Meninos e Lobos (2003); a spelling bee coach in Prova de Fogo (2006); and prominent roles in the mainstream films Predadores (2010) and Cont\u00e1gio (2011). He returned occasionally to the theatre. In April 2008, he played Thurgood Marshall in the one-man show \"Thurgood\" and won a Drama Desk Award. It was later transferred to the screen.In the fall of 2008, Fishburne replaced William Petersen as the male lead investigator on the popular CBS drama CSI: Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o Criminal (2000), but left the show in 2011 to refocus on films and was in turn replaced by Ted Danson. Since then Fishburne has appeared in the Superman film O Homem de A\u00e7o (2013) as Daily Planet chief Perry White.Fishburne has two children, Langston and Montana, from his first marriage to actress Hajna O. Moss. In September 2002, Fishburne married Cuban-American actress Gina Torres.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Gary Brumburgh / gr-home@pacbell.net\n          \n\n", "realName": "Laurence John Fishburne III", "height": "184"},

At age 20, after studying at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, she moved to Europe to pursue a career in modeling. While in Spain she was cast in a regular role in the TV show Dark Justice which was produced in Barcelona for its first season. She followed the series to its new shooting location in Los Angeles the next year. Once in LA she began getting more opportunities, one of which was a TV series Matrix (which coincidentally presaged the movie that would later make her famous), another was being cast as a series regular for Aaron Spelling's television spectacle Models Inc.Carrie-Anne's work was already gaining traction throughout the motion picture casting community when the late great casting director Mali Finn invited Carrie-Anne to audition for The Wachowski's and their top secret sci-fi action project; that activated her explosive film career. The writer/directors recognized Carrie-Anne's empowered yet openhearted leading qualities and following a challenging process of physical and character screen tests they ultimately gave her the opportunity to create the iconic cyber warrior \"Trinity\" in the record breaking, award winning and internationally successful The Matrix trilogy for Warner Bros/Village Roadshow. Her extraordinary performance launched her on to the world stage alongside her \"One\" Keanu Reeves, in stride with Laurence Fishburne and the multifaceted Hugo Weaving. Carrie-Anne Moss galvanized her place in cinematic history as the first woman to triumphantly fight her way through one of the highest grossing sci-fi action franchises of all time.Directly following her phenomenal new-found success Carrie-Anne received a wide range of scripts from studios and A-list filmmakers but it was the complex screenplay Memento that stirred her creative senses. After meeting the then unknown writer/director Christopher Nolan it was without hesitation that she accepted the role of \"Natalie\" in Nolan's directorial debut. Starring opposite the unforgettable Guy Pearce, and produced by Jennifer & Suzanne Todd, Memento became one of the most critically acclaimed and, at that time, the largest grossing independent film in history. Carrie-Anne Moss's remarkable performance won her the coveted Spirit Award for Best Supporting Female that year.Many of Hollywood's prominent directors and producers continued to pursue her for films; she survived the Red Planet for Warner Bros; sweetened Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m's multi Oscar nominated Chocolat with Juliette Binoche, Dame Judi Dench and Johnny Depp; and tracked Suspect Zero alongside Aaron Eckhart and the elusive Sir Ben Kingsley in the Cruise/Wagner produced film.But it was over the next years that Carrie-Anne took on the most important and rewarding role of her life, becoming a mother to her three children. During that same time Carrie-Anne also mothered on screen the watchful Shia LaBeouf in the rear window-esque DreamWorks box-office hit Disturbia; and together with Samuel L. Jackson, led the intense terrorist interrogation of Michael Sheen in Sony's Unthinkable.Carrie-Anne continued to accept many other lead roles on interesting film projects including The Chumscrubber with Ralph Fiennes and Glenn Close; the comedy noir Mini's First Time also starring Alec Baldwin and Luke Wilson; Snow Cake the touching drama with Sigourney Weaver and Alan Rickman; Fireflies in the Garden in the company of Ryan Reynolds, Julia Roberts and Willem Defoe; and the retro zombie rom-com Fido along with Billy Connelly and Dylan Baker. It is Carrie-Anne's inclination towards thought-provoking filmmakers that has inspired her to lend her success to many other indie projects including Normal, Silent Hill, Elephant Song, Pompeii, Brain on Fire, The Bye Bye Man and more...Throughout her career, Carrie-Anne has been attracted to compelling television projects as well, like Ryan Murphy's, before its time, one hour FOX pilot Pretty Handsome where she played the curious wife to a cross-dressing Joseph Fiennes while dealing with her society mother-in-law Blythe Danner; CBS's Vegas a sin city period piece playing Nevada's first woman District Attorney for James Mangold and Nicholas Pileggi, which also starred the lawful Dennis Quaid and gaming Michael Chiklis; and a guest starring arc throughout the second season of AMC's Humans, experimenting as a highly regarded scientist with a deeply personal agenda, working alongside Gemma Chan.Carrie-Anne Moss has recently completed her third and final season as the powerful and enduring attorney \"Jerry Hogarth\" navigating her way through the Marvel universe in Jessica Jones for Netflix opposite Krysten Ritter and for show runner Melissa Rosenberg. In between seasons she tucked into the first bi-lingual English/Norwegian detective crime series Wisting, as an FBI agent that is following the leads to catch a serial killer in the Norwegian landscape. Adapted from the popular William Wisting detective series by novelist J\u00f8rn Lier Horst, Wisting international sales are being handled by distributor Cinenord.Marvel's Jessica Jones season three is expected to launch on Netflix in the spring of 2019.--March 2019--\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Hodgson Management Group (March 2019)\n          \n\n", "realName": null, "height": "174"},

Hugo has an older brother, Simon, and a younger sister, Anna, who both also live and work in Australia. During his early childhood, the Weaving family spent most of their time traveling between Nigeria, Great Britain, and Australia. This was due to the cross-country demands of his father's job in the computer industry. Later, during his teens, Hugo spent three years in England in the seventies attending Queen Elizabeth's Hospital School in Bristol. There, he showed early promise in theater productions and also excelled at history, achieving an A in his O-level examination. He arrived permanently in Australia in 1976 and finished his education at Knox Grammar School, Sydney. He graduated from NIDA (National Institute of Dramatic Art), a college well-known for other alumni such as Mel Gibson and Geoffrey Rush, in 1981. Since then, Hugo has had a steadily successful career in the film, television, and theater industries. However, he has illustrated that, as renowned as he is known for his film work, he feels most at home on stage and continually performs in Australian theater productions, usually with the Sydney Theater Company. With his success has also come extensive recognition. He has won numerous awards, including two Australian Film Institute Awards (AFI) for Best Actor in a Leading Role and three total nominations. The AFI is the Australian equivalent of an Academy Award, and Hugo won for his performances in A Prova (1991) and The Interview (1998). He was also nominated for his performance in Priscilla, a Rainha do Deserto (1994). He garnered the Best Acting prize for The Interview (1998) at the Montreal Film Festival in 1998 in addition to his AFI Award and, that same year, won the Australian Star of the Year. More recently, roles in films such as The Matrix trilogy as Agent Smith and The Lord of the Rings trilogy as Lord Elrond have considerably raised his international profile. His famous and irreplaceable role in The Matrix movies have made him one of the greatest sci-fi villains of the Twenty-first Century. With each new film, television, or theatrical role, Hugo continues to surpass his audience's expectations and remains one of the most versatile performers working today. He resides in Australia and has two children with partner Katrina Greenwood. Though Hugo and Katrina have never married, they've been a committed couple for over 25 years; while Hugo was quoted as saying marriage \"petrified\" him in the 1990s, by middle of the following decade he said he no longer felt that way, and that he and Katrina have toyed with the idea of marrying \"when we're really old\".\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Lady Nephthys\n          \n\n", "realName": "Hugo Wallace Weaving", "height": "188"},

In the mid-1960s, he released a record under the stage name Joe Ritchie titled \"Little Joe Sure Can Sing\", and was also playing guitar with several bands, including Joey Dee and The Starliters.

Scorsese directed De Niro to an Oscar-winning performance as boxer Jake LaMotta in Touro Indom\u00e1vel (1980), which received eight Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director, and is hailed as one of the masterpieces of modern cinema. Scorsese went on to direct A Cor do Dinheiro (1986), A \u00daltima Tenta\u00e7\u00e3o de Cristo (1988), Os Bons Companheiros (1990), Cabo do Medo (1991), A \u00c9poca da Inoc\u00eancia (1993), Cassino (1995) and Kundun (1997), among other films.

Nicholson is also notable for being one of two actors - the other being Michael Caine - who have received Oscar nomination in every decade from the 1960s through the early 2000s.Nicholson was born on April 22, 1937, in Neptune, New Jersey. He was raised believing that his grandmother was his mother, and that his mother, June Frances Nicholson, a showgirl, was his older sister. He discovered the truth in 1975 from a Time magazine journalist who was researching a profile on him. His real father is believed to have been either Donald Furcillo, an Italian American showman, or Eddie King (Edgar Kirschfeld), born in Latvia and also in show business. Jack's mother's ancestry was Irish, and smaller amounts of English, German, Scottish, and Welsh.Nicholson made his film debut in a B-movie titled The Cry Baby Killer (1958). His rise in Hollywood was far from meteoric, and for years, he sustained his career with guest spots in television series and a number of Roger Corman films, including A Loja dos Horrores (1960).Nicholson's first turn in the director's chair was for O Amanh\u00e3 Chega Cedo Demais (1971). Before that, he wrote the screenplay for Viagem ao Mundo da Alucina\u00e7\u00e3o (1967), and co-wrote Os Monkees Est\u00e3o de Volta (1968), a vehicle for The Monkees. His big break came with Sem Destino (1969) and his portrayal of liquor-soaked attorney George Hanson, which earned Nicholson his first Oscar nomination. Nicholson's film career took off in the 1970s with a definitive performance in Cada um Vive como Quer (1970). Nicholson's other notable work during this period includes leading roles in Roman Polanski's noir masterpiece Chinatown (1974) and Um Estranho no Ninho (1975), for which he won his first Best Actor Oscar.The 1980s kicked off with another career-defining role for Nicholson as Jack Torrance in Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Stephen King's novel O Iluminado (1980). A string of well-received films followed, including La\u00e7os de Ternura (1983), which earned Nicholson his second Oscar; A Honra do Poderoso Prizzi (1985), and As Bruxas de Eastwick (1987). He portrayed another renowned villain, The Joker, in Tim Burton's Batman (1989). In the 1990s, he starred in such varied films as Quest\u00e3o de Honra (1992), for which he received another Oscar nomination, and a dual role in Marte Ataca! (1996).Although a glimpse at the darker side of Nicholson's acting range reappeared in Os Infiltrados (2006), the actor's most recent roles highlight the physical and emotional complications one faces late in life. The most notable of these is the unapologetically misanthropic Melvin Udall in Melhor \u00e9 Imposs\u00edvel (1997), for which he won his third Oscar. Shades of this persona are apparent in As Confiss\u00f5es de Schmidt (2002), Algu\u00e9m tem que Ceder (2003), and Antes de Partir (2007). In addition to his Academy Awards and Oscar nominations, Nicholson has seven Golden Globe Awards, and received a Kennedy Center Honor in 2001. He also became one of the youngest actors to receive the American Film Institute's Life Achievement award in 1994.Nicholson has five children: Eldest daughter Jennifer Nicholson (b. 1963), from his marriage to Sandra Knight, which ended in 1968; Caleb James Goddard (b. 1970) with Susan Anspach; Honey Hollman (b. 1981) with Danish supermodel, Winnie Hollman; and Lorraine Nicholson (b. 1990) and Ray Nicholson (b. 1992) with Rebecca Broussard. Nicholson's longest relationship was the 17 years he spent with actress Anjelica Huston; this ended when Broussard become pregnant with his child.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Pedro Borges\n          \n\n", "realName": "John Joseph Nicholson", "height": "177"},

She took a temporary job as a receptionist and signed up for acting classes at night. Soon she was working regularly in television and film, but after marrying producer Jerry Bick and having two sons, the actress took a long hiatus to raise her children.Returning to work in 1974 in Robert Altman's Renegados At\u00e9 a \u00daltima Rajada (1974), Fletcher came to the attention of director Milos Forman, who was casting the difficult role of the nurse in Um Estranho no Ninho (1975). She won the role -- and then the Academy Award -- portraying deadly, inflexible Nurse Ratched, who has since become a cultural icon. Numerous film roles followed, including co-starring turns with Peter Falk in O Detetive Desastrado (1978) and with Richard Burton in O Exorcista II: O Herege (1977).

He was born in Tsingtao, China, to Japanese parents and grew up in Dalian. He did not set foot in Japan until he was 21. His father was an importer and a commercial photographer, and young Toshiro worked in his father's studio for a time after graduating from Dalian Middle School. He was automatically drafted into the Japanese army when he turned 20, and enlisted in the Air Force where he was attached to the Aerial Photography Unit for the duration of the World War II. In 1947 he took a test for Kajir\u00f4 Yamamoto, who recommended him to director Senkichi Taniguchi, thus leading to Mifune's first film role in Shin baka jidai: k\u00f4hen (1947). Mifune then met and bonded with director Akira Kurosawa, and the two joined to become the most prominent actor-director pairing in all Japanese cinema. Beginning with O Anjo Embriagado (1948), Mifune appeared in 16 of Kurosawa's films, most of which have become world-renowned classics. In Kurosawa's pictures, especially Rashomon (1950), Mifune would become the most famous Japanese actor in the world. A dynamic and ferocious actor, he excelled in action roles, but also had the depth to plumb intricate and subtle dramatic parts. A personal rift during the filming of O Barba Ruiva (1965) ended the Mifune-Kurosawa collaboration, but Mifune continued to perform leading roles in major films both in Japan and in foreign countries. He was twice named Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival (for Yojimbo, o Guarda-Costas (1961) and O Barba Ruiva (1965)). In 1963 he formed his own production company, directing one film and producing several others. In his later years he gained new fame in the title role of the American TV miniseries Shogun (1980), and appeared infrequently in cameo roles after that. His last years were plagued with Alzheimer's Syndrome and he died of organ failure in 1997, a few months before the death of the director with whose name he will forever be linked, Akira Kurosawa.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Jim Beaver <jumblejim@prodigy.net>\n          \n\n", "realName": "Sanchuan Minlang", "height": "174"},

A native of southern Japan, Shimura was a descendant of the samurai warrior class. Following university training, he founded a theatre company, Shichigatsu-za (\"July Theatre\"). In 1930 he joined a professional company, Kindai-za (\"Modern Theatre\"). Four years later he signed with the Kinema Shinko film studio. He found a niche playing samurai roles for various studios, then signed a long-term contract with Toho Studios in 1943. He appeared in an average of six films a year for Toho over the next four decades. His greatest critical acclaim came in more than 20 roles for Kurosawa, though he is almost as well recognized outside Japan for his kindly doctor role in the original \"Godzilla\" (Godzilla (1954)). Shimura's triumph was his unforgettable performance as a dying bureaucrat in Kurosawa's Viver (1952). He continued to act steadily, in good films and bad, almost until his death, culminating with Kurosawa's Kagemusha, a Sombra de um Samurai (1980). He is often described as filling the spot for Kurosawa that Ward Bond filled for John Ford--an ever-present and reliable character player who consistently supplied a solidity and strength to whatever film he appeared in. Shimura was, to be sure, even a finer actor than Bond, and his range was enormous, from \"Ikiru\"'s diffident clerk to the leader of the Seven Samurai in Kurosawa's Os Sete Samurais (1954).

Within a few years, Kurosawa had achieved sufficient stature to allow him greater creative freedom. O Anjo Embriagado (1948)--\"Drunken Angel\"--was the first film he made without extensive studio interference, and marked his first collaboration with Toshir\u00f4 Mifune. In the coming decades, the two would make 16 movies together, and Mifune became as closely associated with Kurosawa's films as was John Wayne with the films of Kurosawa's idol, John Ford. After working in a wide range of genres, Kurosawa made his international breakthrough film Rashomon (1950) in 1950. It won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival, and first revealed the richness of Japanese cinema to the West. The next few years saw the low-key, touching Viver (1952) (Living), the epic Os Sete Samurais (1954), the barbaric, riveting Shakespeare adaptation Trono Manchado de Sangue (1957), and a fun pair of samurai comedies Yojimbo, o Guarda-Costas (1961) and Sanjuro (1962). After a lean period in the late 1960s and early 1970s, though, Kurosawa attempted suicide. He survived, and made a small, personal, low-budget picture with Dodeskaden - O Caminho da Vida (1970), a larger-scale Russian co-production Dersu Uzala (1975) and, with the help of admirers Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas, the samurai tale Kagemusha, a Sombra de um Samurai (1980), which Kurosawa described as a dry run for Ran (1985), an epic adaptation of Shakespeare's \"King Lear.\" He continued to work into his eighties with the more personal Sonhos (1990), Raps\u00f3dia em Agosto (1991) and Madadayo (1993). Kurosawa's films have always been more popular in the West than in his native Japan, where critics have viewed his adaptations of Western genres and authors (William Shakespeare, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Maxim Gorky and Evan Hunter) with suspicion - but he's revered by American and European film-makers, who remade Rashomon (1950) as Quatro Confiss\u00f5es (1964), Os Sete Samurais (1954), as Sete Homens e um Destino (1960), Yojimbo, o Guarda-Costas (1961), as Por Um Punhado de D\u00f3lares (1964) and A Fortaleza Escondida (1958), as Star Wars, Epis\u00f3dio IV: Uma Nova Esperan\u00e7a (1977).\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Michael Brooke <michael@everyman.demon.co.uk>\n          \n\n", "realName": null, "height": "182"},

He began his career as a stage actor during the 1980s before obtaining supporting roles in film and television. He gained critical acclaim in the early 1990s that culminated in his first Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the neo-noir crime thriller The Usual Suspects (1995), and an Academy Award for Best Actor for midlife crisis-themed drama American Beauty (1999).His other starring roles have included the comedy-drama film Swimming with Sharks (1994), psychological thriller Seven (1995), the neo-noir crime film L.A. Confidential (1997), the drama Pay It Forward (2000), the science fiction-mystery film K-PAX (2001)In Broadway theatre, Spacey won a Tony Award for his role in Lost in Yonkers. He was the artistic director of the Old Vic theatre in London from 2004 until stepping down in mid-2015. Since 2013, Spacey has played Frank Underwood in the Netflix political drama series House of Cards. His work in House of Cards earned him Golden Globe Award and Emmy Award nominations for Best Actor.As enigmatic as he is talented, Kevin Spacey for years kept the details of his private life closely guarded. As he explained in a 1998 interview with the London Evening Standard, \"the less you know about me, the easier it is to convince you that I am that character on screen. It allows an audience to come into a movie theatre and believe I am that person\". In October 2017, he ended many years of media speculation about his personal life by confirming that he had enjoyed sexual relations with both men and women but now identified as homosexual.There are, however, certain biographical facts to be had - for starters, Kevin Spacey Fowler was the youngest of three children born to Kathleen Ann (Knutson) and Thomas Geoffrey Fowler, in South Orange, New Jersey. His ancestry includes Swedish (from his maternal grandfather) and English. His mother was a personal secretary, his father a technical writer whose irregular job prospects led the family all over the country. The family eventually settled in southern California, where young Kevin developed into quite a little hellion - after he set his sister's tree house on fire, he was shipped off to the Northridge Military Academy, only to be thrown out a few months later for pinging a classmate on the head with a tire. Spacey then found his way to Chatsworth High School in the San Fernando Valley, where he managed to channel his dramatic tendencies into a successful amateur acting career. In his senior year, he played \"Captain von Trapp\" opposite classmate Mare Winningham's \"Maria\" in \"The Sound of Music\" (the pair later graduated as co-valedictorians). Spacey claims that his interest in acting - and his nearly encyclopedic accumulation of film knowledge - began at an early age, when he would sneak downstairs to watch the late late show on TV. Later, in high school, he and his friends cut class to catch revival films at the NuArt Theater. The adolescent Spacey worked up celebrity impersonations (James Stewart and Johnny Carson were two of his favorites) to try out on the amateur comedy club circuit.He briefly attended Los Angeles Valley College, then left (on the advice of another Chatsworth classmate, Val Kilmer) to join the drama program at Juilliard. After two years of training he was anxious to work, so he quit Juilliard sans diploma and signed up with the New York Shakespeare Festival. His first professional stage appearance was as a messenger in the 1981 production of \"Henry VI\".Festival head Joseph Papp ushered the young actor out into the \"real world\" of theater, and the next year Spacey made his Broadway debut in Henrik Ibsen's \"Ghosts\". He quickly proved himself as an energetic and versatile performer (at one point, he rotated through all the parts in David Rabe's \"Hurlyburly\"). In 1986, he had the chance to work with his idol and future mentor, Jack Lemmon, on a production of Eugene O'Neill's \"Long Day's Journey Into Night\". While his interest soon turned to film, Spacey would remain active in the theater community - in 1991, he won a Tony Award for his turn as \"Uncle Louie\" in Neil Simon's Broadway hit \"Lost in Yonkers\" and, in 1999, he returned to the boards for a revival of O'Neill's \"The Iceman Cometh\".Spacey's film career began modestly, with a small part as a subway thief in A Dif\u00edcil Arte de Amar (1986). Deemed more of a \"character actor\" than a \"leading man\", he stayed on the periphery in his next few films, but attracted attention for his turn as beady-eyed villain \"Mel Profitt\" on the TV series O Homem da M\u00e1fia (1987). Profitt was the first in a long line of dark, manipulative characters that would eventually make Kevin Spacey a household name: he went on to play a sinister office manager in O Sucesso a Qualquer Pre\u00e7o (1992), a sadistic Hollywood exec in O Pre\u00e7o da Ambi\u00e7\u00e3o (1994), and, most famously, creepy, smooth-talking eyewitness Verbal Kint in Os Suspeitos (1995).The \"Suspects\" role earned Spacey an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor and catapulted him into the limelight. That same year, he turned in another complex, eerie performance in David Fincher's thriller Seven: Os Sete Crimes Capitais (1995) (Spacey refused billing on the film, fearing that it might compromise the ending if audiences were waiting for him to appear). By now, the scripts were pouring in. After appearing in Al Pacino's Ricardo III - Um Ensaio (1996), Spacey made his own directorial debut with Ciladas da Sorte (1996), a low-key but well received hostage drama. He then jumped back into acting, winning critical accolades for his turns as flashy detective Jack Vincennes in Los Angeles: Cidade Proibida (1997) and genteel, closeted murder suspect Jim Williams in Meia-Noite no Jardim do Bem e do Mal (1997). In October 1999, just four days after the dark suburban comedy Beleza Americana (1999) opened in US theaters, Spacey received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Little did organizers know that his role in Beauty would turn out to be his biggest success yet - as Lester Burnham, a middle-aged corporate cog on the brink of psychological meltdown, he tapped into a funny, savage character that captured audiences' imaginations and earned him a Best Actor Oscar.No longer relegated to offbeat supporting parts, Spacey seems poised to redefine himself as a Hollywood headliner. He says he's finished exploring the dark side - but, given his attraction to complex characters, that mischievous twinkle will never be too far from his eyes.In February 2003 Spacey made a major move back to the theatre. He was appointed Artistic Director of the new company set up to save the famous Old Vic theatre, The Old Vic Theatre Company. Although he did not undertake to stop appearing in movies altogether, he undertook to remain in this leading post for ten years, and to act in as well as to direct plays during that time. His first production, of which he was the director, was the September 2004 British premiere of the play Cloaca by Maria Goos (made into a film, Cloaca (2003)). Spacey made his UK Shakespearean debut in the title role in Richard II in 2005. In 2006 he got movie director Robert Altman to direct for the stage the little-known Arthur Miller play Resurrection Blues, but that was a dismal failure. However Spacey remained optimistic, and insisted that a few mistakes are part of the learning process. He starred thereafter with great success in Eugene O'Neill's A Moon for the Misbegotten along with Colm Meaney and Eve Best, and in 2007 that show transferred to Broadway. In February 2008 Spacey put on a revival of the David Mamet 1988 play Speed-the-Plow in which he took one of the three roles, the others being taken by Jeff Goldblum and Laura Michelle Kelly.In 2013, Spacey took on the lead role in an original Netflix series, House of Cards (2013). Based upon a British show of the same name, House of Cards is an American political drama. The show's first season received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination to include Outstanding lead actor in a drama series. In 2017, he played a memorable role as a villain in the action thriller Em Ritmo de Fuga (2017).\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            IMDb Editors\n          \n\n", "realName": "Kevin Spacey Fowler", "height": "178"},

At the same time he developed an interest in filmmaking. With a group of friends he started producing experimental videos and video art. They won a huge number of awards in Brazilian video festivals. After that, the group formed a small independent company called Olhar Eletr\u00f4nico.After working in independent television during nine years, in the eighties, Meirelles gravitated towards publicity and commercials. He also became the director of a very popular 180 episodes of a children's television show called Ra Tim Bum.In the early 90s, together with Paulo Morelli and Andrea Barata Ribeiro, he opened the O2 Filmes production company which became the biggest production company in Brasil working from development until distribution, including complete post-production facilities.His first feature,in 1998, was the family film \"Menino Maluquinho 2: A Aventura\". His next feature, \"Dom\u00e9sticas\" (2001), exposed the invisible world of five Brazilian maids in S\u00e3o Paulo and their secret dreams and desires.In 1997 he read the Brazilian best-seller \"Cidade de Deus/City of God\", written by Paulo Lins, and decided to turn it into a movie despite an the intimidating story that involves more than 350 characters. Once the the screenplay, written by Br\u00e1ulio Mantovani, was ready, Meirelles gathered a crew mixed with professional technicians and inexperienced actors chosen between the youngsters living in the favelas surrounding Rio de Janeiro.The film was a huge success in Brazil and began to attract attention around the world, after it screened at the Cannes Film Festival in 2002. \"Cidade de Deus/City of God\" (2003) has won nore than 50 awards from film festivals and societies all over the world, as well as four 2004 Oscar nominations, including a Best Director for Fernando Meirelles.Since 2002 , Meirelles has split his time between international feature and TV series in Brazil.

In 1999, sought after by Ridley Scott, he played a cameo role in the American Blockbuster movie \"the Gladiator\", winner of five Oscars. In the following years, he worked on two occasions for the American brand, Hallmark, firstly in the film \"In Love and War\" by John Kent Harrison, a film for American TV, and then in the popular Hallmark card commercial \"Bicycle boy\", which was used for several years. He took a break from the world of cinema to concentrate on his studies and sport, but during that time he still made guest appearances on Italian TV, both on the Italian RAI and Mediaset channels.

His parents, from the continental United States, were then serving as Children of God missionaries. His mother is from a Jewish family from New York, while his father, from California, is of mostly British Isles descent. As a youngster, Joaquin took his cues from older siblings River Phoenix and Rain Phoenix, changing his name to Leaf to match their earthier monikers. When the children were encouraged to develop their creative instincts, he followed their lead into acting. Younger sisters Liberty Phoenix and Summer Phoenix rounded out the talented troupe.The family moved often, traveling through Central and South America (and adopting the surname \"Phoenix\" to celebrate their new beginnings) but, by the time Joaquin was age 6, they had more or less settled in the Los Angeles area. Arlyn found work as a secretary at NBC, and John turned his talents to landscaping. They eventually found an agent who was willing to represent all five children, and the younger generation dove into television work. Commercials for meat, milk, and junk food were off-limits (the kids were all raised as strict vegans), but they managed to find plenty of work pushing other, less sinister products. Joaquin's first real acting gig was a guest appearance on River's sitcom, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1982).He worked with his brother again on the afterschool special ABC Afterschool Specials: Backwards: The Riddle of Dyslexia (1984), then struck out on his own in other made-for-TV productions. He made his big-screen debut as the youngest crew member in the interstellar romp SpaceCamp: Aventura no Espa\u00e7o (1986), then won his first starring turn in the Cold War-era drama Corrida Contra o Tempo (1987). In the late '80s, the Phoenix clan decided to pull up stakes and relocate again--this time to Florida. River's film career had enough momentum to sustain the move, but Joaquin wasn't sure what lay in store for him in the Sunshine State. As it happened, Universal Pictures had just opened a new studio in the area and he was cast almost immediately as an angst-ridden adolescent in O Tiro que n\u00e3o Saiu pela Culatra (1989). His performance was very well-received, but Joaquin decided to withdraw from acting for a while--he was frustrated with the dearth of interesting roles for actors his age, and he wanted to see more of the world.His parents were in the process of separating, so he struck out for Mexico with his father. Joaquin returned to the public eye three years later under tragic circumstances. On October 31, 1993, he was at The Viper Room (a Los Angeles nightclub partly-owned by Johnny Depp) when his brother River collapsed from a drug overdose and later died. Joaquin made the call to 911, which was rebroadcast on radio and television the world over. Months later, at the insistence of friends and colleagues, Joaquin began reading through scripts again, but he was reluctant to re-enter the acting life until he found just the right part. He finally signed up to work with Gus Van Sant (who had directed River in Garotos de Programa (1991) and At\u00e9 as Vaqueiras Ficam Tristes (1993)) to star as Nicole Kidman's obsessive devotee in Um Sonho sem Limites (1995). The performance made Joaquin (who had dropped Leaf and reverted to his birth name) a critics' darling in his own right.His follow-up turn in C\u00edrculo de Paix\u00f5es (1997) scored more critical kudos and, perhaps more importantly, introduced him to his one-time fianc\u00e9e Liv Tyler. (The pair dated for almost three years.) He returned to the big screen later that year with a supporting role in Oliver Stone's Reviravolta (1997), then played a locked-up drug scapegoat in Pela Vida de um Amigo (1998). He and \"Paradise\" co-star Vince Vaughn re-teamed almost immediately for the small-town murder caper Clay Pigeons (1998), which Joaquin followed with a turn as a porn store clerk in 8mm: Oito Mil\u00edmetros (1999). The film that confirmed Phoenix as a star was the historical epic Gladiador (2000). The Roman epic cast him as the selfish, paranoid young emperor Commodus opposite Russell Crowe's swarthy hero. Determined to make his character as real as possible, Phoenix gained weight and cultivated a pasty complexion during the shoot. He received international attention and an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor for that role.Later that year, he appeared in two indies, playing a dock worker in Caminho sem Volta (2000) (which he counts among his favorite experiences--and one of the only films of his that he can sit through) and the priest in charge of the Marquis de Sade's asylum in Contos Proibidos do Marqu\u00eas de Sade (2000). He received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor as the legendary musician Johnny Cash in the biography Johnny & June (2005). He also recorded an album, the film's soundtrack, for which he received the Grammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            IMDb Editors\n          \n\n", "realName": "Joaquin Rafael Bottom", "height": "173"},

Born Frances Hardman Conroy in Monroe, Georgia on November 13, 1953, she attended high school in Long Island and experienced classes at the Neighborhood Playhouse as a teenager. The pale, blue-eyed redhead also studied drama at Dickinson College and the Juilliard School (BFA) where she was taught, at the latter college, by theater greats John Houseman and Marian Seldes.Following potent dramatic roles in such classical productions as \"Mother Courage...and Her Children,\" \"King Lear,\" \"All's Well That Ends Well,\" \"Measure for Measure\" and \"Othello\" (as Desdemona) in the late 70s, Frances made her Broadway debut with \"The Lady from Dubuque\" in 1980. She went on to earn a well-respected name for herself under the Broadway and off-Broadway lights throughout the 1980s in such esteemed plays as \"Our Town\" (as Mrs. Gibbs), \"The Little Foxes (as Birdie) and \"In the Summer House.\" She also appeared with Ms. Seldes in the well-received plays \"Ring 'Round the Moon\" and \"A Bright Room Called Day.\"A performer with the The Acting Company, Frances won a Drama Desk Award for \"The Secret Rapture\" and an Obie for \"The Last Yankee.\" In 2000 she received the Outer Critics Circle Award and a Tony nomination for \"The Ride Down Mt. Morgan.\" Her other Broadway credits include \"Ring Round the Moon\", \"The Little Foxes\", \"The Rehearsal\" (Drama Desk Nominee), \"Broken Glass\", \"In the Summer House\" (Drama Desk Nominee) and \"The Secret Rapture\" (Drama Desk Nominee). Conroy's numerous Off- Broadway plays include \"The Dinner Party\", \"The Skin of Our Teeth\", \"The Last Yankee\" and \"Othello\" (Drama Desk Nominee).An actress of subtle power, great depth and astonishing versatility, she has both an aloof serenity and faintly sad/sensitive ambiance that makes her all the more mysterious and intriguing. She came out to California in 1985 at the invitation of director Houseman and appeared in more theater plays, including \"Richard III,\" at San Diego's Globe Theater. She also earned a sprinkling of generally overlooked film and TV parts, including small parts in Woody Allen's Manhattan (1979) (debut), A Outra (1988) and Crimes e Pecados (1989). Showing a distinct flair for the offbeat and neurotic, nothing really pushed the envelope for her on screen quite like her series' turn as the dowdy, emotionally frail undertaker's widow Ruth Fisher in the cult hit TV series A Sete Palmos (2001).

He was of Scottish, Ulster-Scots, and some English, descent. Stewart was educated at a local prep school, Mercersburg Academy, where he was a keen athlete (football and track), musician (singing and accordion playing), and sometime actor.In 1929, he won a place at Princeton University, where he studied architecture with some success and became further involved with the performing arts as a musician and actor with the University Players. After graduation, engagements with the University Players took him around the northeastern United States, including a run on Broadway in 1932. But work dried up as the Great Depression deepened, and it was not until 1934, when he followed his friend Henry Fonda to Hollywood, that things began to pick up.After his first screen appearance in Art Trouble (1934), he worked for a time for MGM as a contract player and slowly began making a name for himself in increasingly high-profile roles throughout the rest of the 1930s. His famous collaborations with Frank Capra, in Do Mundo Nada se Leva (1938), A Mulher Faz o Homem (1939), and, after World War II, A Felicidade N\u00e3o se Compra (1946) helped to launch his career as a star and to establish his screen persona as the likable everyman.Having learned to fly in 1935, he was drafted into the United States Army in 1940 as a private (after twice failing the medical for being underweight). During the course of World War II he rose to the rank of colonel, first as an instructor at home in the United States, and later on combat missions in Europe. He remained involved with the United States Air Force Reserve after the war and retired in 1959 as a brigadier general.Stewart's acting career took off properly after the war. During the course of his long professional life, he had roles in some of Hollywood's best remembered films, starring in a string of Westerns (bringing his \"everyman\" qualities to movies like O Homem que Matou o Fac\u00ednora (1962)), biopics (Sangue de Campe\u00e3o (1949), M\u00fasica e L\u00e1grimas (1954), and \u00c1guia Solit\u00e1ria (1957), for instance) thrillers (most notably his frequent collaborations with Alfred Hitchcock) and even some screwball comedies.On June 25, 1997, a thrombosis formed in his right leg, leading to a pulmonary embolism a week later, Surrounded by his children on July 2, 1997, James Stewart died at age 89 at his home in Beverly Hills, California, with his last words to his family being, \"I'm going to be with Gloria now.\".\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Henry Willis\n          \n\n", "realName": "James Maitland Stewart", "height": "191"},

A small town - a population of less than 3,000 people - Denison was located by the Boyer River, and was the county seat of Crawford County. Donna grew up as a farm girl, much like many young girls in western Iowa, except for one thing - Donna was very beautiful. That wasn't to say that others weren't as pretty, it's just that Donna's beauty stood out from all the other local girls, so much so that she won a beauty contest in Denison. Upon graduation from high school Donna left for college in Los Angeles, in the hopes of eventually entering movies. While at Los Angeles City College, she pursued her dream by participating in several college stage productions. In addition to the plays, she also won the title of Campus Queen. At one of those stage plays Donna was spotted by an MGM talent scout and was signed to a contract. Her first film was a minor role in MGM's Quem com Ferro Fere (1941). That was followed by a small part in Calouros na Broadway (1941), with Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland as a secretary. Afterwards, MGM began giving her better parts, in films such as Ao Toque do Clarim (1942), O Id\u00edlio de Andy Hardy (1942) and A Vida Tem Cada Uma! (1943). In 1944 she received second billing playing Carol Halliday in Senhor Recruta! (1944), a comedy about a reporter drafted into the army who eventually meets up with Donna's character as a worker in the canteen. The following year Donna starred in O Retrato de Dorian Gray (1945), her best role to date. It was a love story set in London in 1890. It got mixed critical reviews but did well at the box-office. Donna was now one of the leading ladies of Hollywood. In 1946 she starred in what is probably her best-known role, as the wife of James Stewart in the classic A Felicidade N\u00e3o se Compra (1946). This timeless story is a holiday staple to this day. The film also starred Lionel Barrymore and Thomas Mitchell. The next year Donna starred as Ann Daniels in Paramount's C\u00f3digo de Honra (1948) with Alan Ladd, which did well at the box-office. Her next role was the strongest she had had yet--Caminhos Sem Fim (1949), again with Ladd. It was one of the best mystery dramas to come out of Hollywood in a long time, and did very well at the box office. As the 1940s faded out and the 1950s stormed in, Donna's roles got bigger but were mainly of the wholesome, girl-next-door type. In 1953, however, she starred as the hostess Alma in the widely acclaimed A um Passo da Eternidade (1953). She was so good in that film she was nominated for and won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, beating out such veterans as Thelma Ritter and Marjorie Rambeau. The film itself won for Best Picture and remains a classic to this day. Later that year Donna starred in Sofrendo da Bola (1953), a comedy with Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin. Three years later she landed the role of Sacajawea in Aventura Sangrenta (1955), the story of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, starring Charlton Heston and Fred MacMurray. After finishing A Verdade D\u00f3i (1958), Donna began her own TV series (produced by her husband), The Donna Reed Show (1958), a hit that ran for eight years. She was so effective in the show that she was nominated for TV's prestigious Emmy Award as Best Actress every year from 1959-1962. She was far more popular in TV than on the screen. After the run of the program, Donna took some time away from show business before coming back in a couple of made-for-TV movies (in 1974, she had made a feature called Yellow-Headed Summer (1974), but it was never released). She did get the role of Ellie Ewing Farlow in the hit TV series Dallas (1978) during the 1984-85 season. It was to be her final public performance. On January 14, 1986, less than two weeks before her 65th birthday, she died of pancreatic cancer in Beverly Hills, California. Grover Asmus, her husband, created the Donna Reed Foundation for the Performing Arts in her hometown of Denison. The foundation helps others who desire a career in the arts. Donna never forgot her roots. She was still a farm girl at heart.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Denny Jackson\n          \n\n", "realName": "Donnabelle Mullenger", "height": "161"},

On May 10, 1903, his family left for America aboard the ship Germania, arriving in New York on May 23rd. \"There's no ventilation, and it stinks like hell. They're all miserable. It's the most degrading place you could ever be,\" Capra said about his Atlantic passage. \"Oh, it was awful, awful. It seems to always be storming, raining like hell and very windy, with these big long rolling Atlantic waves. Everybody was sick, vomiting. God, they were sick. And the poor kids were always crying.\"The family boarded a train for the trip to California, where Frank's older brother Benjamin was living. On their journey, they subsisted on bread and bananas, as their lack of English made it impossible for them to ask for any other kind of foodstuffs. On June 3, the Capra family arrived at the Southern Pacific station in Los Angeles, at the time, a small city of approximately 102,000 people. The family stayed with Capra's older brother Benjamin, and on September 14, 1903, Frank began his schooling at the Castelar Elementary school.In 1909, he entered Los Angeles' Manual Arts High School. Capra made money selling newspapers in downtown L.A. after school and on Saturdays, sometimes working with his brother Tony. When sales were slow, Tony punched Frank to attract attention, which would attract a crowd and make Frank's papers sell quicker. Frank later became part of a two-man music combo, playing at various places in the red light district of L.A., including brothels, getting paid a dollar per night, performing the popular songs. He also worked as a janitor at the high school in the early mornings. It was at high school that he became interested in the theater, typically doing back-stage work such as lighting.Capra's family pressured him to drop out of school and go to work, but he refused, as he wanted to partake fully of the American Dream, and for that he needed an education. Capra later reminisced that his family \"thought I was a bum. My mother would slap me around; she wanted me to quit school. My teachers would urge me to keep going....I was going to school because I had a fight on my hands that I wanted to win.\"Capra graduated from high school on January 27, 1915, and in September of that year, he entered the Throop College of Technology (later the California Institute of Technology) to study chemical engineering. The school's annual tuition was $250, and Capra received occasional financial support from his family, who were resigned to the fact they had a scholar in their midst. Throop had a fine arts department, and Capra discovered poetry and the essays of Montaigne, which he fell in love with, while matriculating at the technical school. He then decided to write.\"It was a great discovery for me. I discovered language. I discovered poetry. I discovered poetry at Caltech, can you imagine that? That was a big turning point in my life. I didn't know anything could be so beautiful.\" Capra penned \"The Butler's Failure,\" about an English butler provoked by poverty to murder his employer, then to suicide.\"Capra was singled out for a cash award of $250 for having the highest grades in the school. Part of his prize was a six-week trip across the U.S. and Canada. When Capra's father, Turiddu, died in 1916, Capra started working at the campus laundry to make money.After the U.S. Congress declared War on Germany on April 6, 1917, Capra enlisted in the Army, and while he was not a naturalized citizen yet, he was allowed to join the military as part of the Coastal Artillery. Capra became a supply officer for the student soldiers at Throop, who have been enrolled in a Reserve Officers Training Corps program. At his enlistment, Capra discovered he was not an American citizen; he became naturalized in 1920.On September 15, 1918, Capra graduated from Throop with his bachelor's degree, and was inducted into the U.S. Army on October 18th and shipped out to the Presidio at San Francisco. An armistice ending the fighting of World War One would be declared in less than a month. While at the Presidio, Capra became ill with the Spanish influenza that claimed 20 million lives worldwide. He was discharged from the Army on December 13th and moved to his brother Ben's home in L.A. While recuperating, Capra answered a cattle call for extras for John Ford's film \"The The Outcasts of Poker Flat (1919) (Capra, cast as a laborer in the Ford picture, introduced himself to the film's star, Harry Carey. Two decades later, Capra, designated the #1 director in Hollywood by \"Time\" magazine, would cast Carey and his movie actress wife Olive in A Mulher Faz o Homem (1939) for which Carey won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination).While living at his mother's house, Capra took on a wide variety of manual laboring jobs, including errand boy and ditch digger, even working as an orange tree pruner at 20 cents a day. He continued to be employed as an extra at movie studios and as a prop buyer at an independent studio at Sunset Boulevard and Gower Street, which later became the home of Columbia Pictures, where Capra would make his reputation as the most successful movie director of the 1930s. Most of his time was spent unemployed and idle, which gave credence to his family's earlier opposition to him seeking higher education. Capra wrote short stories but was unable to get them published. He eventually got work as a live-in tutor for the son of \"Lucky\" Baldwin, a rich gambler. (He later used the Baldwin estate as a location for Dirig\u00edvel (1931)).Smitten by the movie bug, in August of that year, Capra, former actor W. M. Plank, and financial backer Ida May Heitmann incorporated the Tri-State Motion Picture Co. in Nevada. Tri-State produced three short films in Nevada in 1920, Don't Change Your Husband (1919), The Pulse of Life (1917), and The Scar of Love (1920), all directed by Plank, and possibly based on story treatments written by Capra. The films were failures, and Capra returned to Los Angeles when Tri-State broke up. In March 1920, Capra was employed by CBC Film Sales Co., the corporate precursor of Columbia Films, where he also worked as an editor and director on a series called \"Screen Snapshots.\" He quit CBC in August and moved to San Francisco, but the only jobs he could find were that of bookseller and door-to-door salesman. Once again seeming to fulfill his family's prophecy, he turned to gambling, and also learned to ride the rails with a hobo named Frank Dwyer. There was also a rumor that he became a traveling salesman specializing in worthless securities, according to a \"Time\" magazine story \"Columbia's Gem\" (August 8, 1938 issue, V.32, No. 6).Still based in San Francisco in 1921, producer Walter Montague hired Capra for $75 per week to help direct the short movie The Ballad of Fisher's Boarding House (1922), which was based on a poem by Rudyard Kipling. Montague, a former actor, had the dubious idea that foggy San Francisco was destined to become the capital of movies, and that he could make a fortune making movies based on poems. Capra helped Montague produced the one-reeler, which was budgeted at $1,700 and subsequently sold to the Pathe Exchange for $3,500. Capra quit Montague when he demanded that the next movie be based upon one of his own poems.Unable to find another professional filmmaking job, Capra hired himself out as a maker of shorts for the public-at-large while working as an assistant at Walter Ball's film lab. Finally, in October 1921, the Paul Gerson Picture Corp. hired him to help make its two-reel comedies, around the time that he began dating the actress Helen Edith Howe, who would become his first wife. Capra continued to work for both Ball and Gerson, primarily as a cutter. On November 25, 1923, Capra married Helen Howell, and the couple soon moved to Hollywood.Hal Roach hired Capra as a gag-writer for the \"Our Gang\" series in January, 1924. After writing the gags for five \"Our Gang\" comedies in seven weeks, he asked Roach to make him a director. When Roach refused (he somewhat rightly felt he had found the right man in director Bob McGowan), Capra quit. Roach's arch rival Mack Sennett subsequently hired him as a writer, one of a six-man team that wrote for silent movie comedian Harry Langdon, the last major star of the rapidly disintegrating Mack Sennett Studios, and reigning briefly as fourth major silent comedian after Charles Chaplin, Buster Keaton, and Harold Lloyd. Capra began working with the Harry Langdon production unit as a gag writer, first credited on the short Plain Clothes (1925).As Harry Langdon became more popular, his production unit at Sennett had moved from two- to three-reelers before Langdon, determined to follow the example of Chaplin, Keaton, and Lloyd, went into features. After making his first feature-length comedy, His First Flame (1927) for Sennett, Langdon signed a three-year contract with Sol Lesser's First National Pictures to annually produce two feature-length comedies at a fixed fee per film. For a multitude of reasons Mack Sennett was never able to retain top talent. On September 15, 1925, Harry Langdon left Sennett in an egotistical rage, taking many of his key production personnel with him. Sennett promoted Capra to director but fired him after three days in his new position. In addition to the Langdon comedies, Capra had also written material for other Sennett films, eventually working on twenty-five movies.After being sacked by Sennett, Capra was hired as a gag-writer by Harry Langdon, working on Langdon's first First National feature-length film, O Andarilho (1926). The movie was directed by Harry Edwards who had directed all of Harry Langdon's films at Sennett. His first comedy for First National, O Andarilho (1926) did well at the box office, but it had ran over budget, which came out of Langdon's end. Harry Edwards was sacked, and for his next picture, O Homem Forte (1926), Langdon promoted Capra to director, boosting his salary to $750 per week. The movie was a hit, but trouble was brewing among members of the Harry Langdon company. Langdon was increasingly believing his own press.His marriage with Helen began to unravel when it is discovered that she had a life-threatening ectopic pregnancy that had to be terminated. In order to cope with the tragedy, Capra became a work-a-holic while Helen turned to drink. The deterioration of his marriage was mirrored by the disintegration of his professional relationship with Harry Langdonduring the making of the new feature, Pinto Cal\u00e7udo (1927).The movie, which was released in March 1927, proved to be Capra's last with Harry Langdon, as the comedian soon sacked Capra after its release. Capra later explained the principle of Langdon comedies to James Agee, \"It is the principal of the brick: If there was a rule for writing Langdon material, it was this: his only ally was God. Harry Langdon might be saved by a brick falling on a cop, but it was verboten that he in any way motivated the bricks fall.\"During the production of Long Pants (1926), Capra had a falling out with Langdon. Screenwriter Arthur Ripley's dark sensibility did not mesh well with that of the more optimistic Capra, and Harry Langdon usually sided with Ripley. The picture fell behind schedule and went over budget, and since Langdon was paid a fixed fee for each film, this represented a financial loss to his own Harry Langdon Corp. Stung by the financial set-back, and desiring to further emulate the great Chaplin, Harry Langdon made a fateful decision: He fired Capra and decided to direct himself. (Langdon's next three movies for First National were dismal failures, the two surviving films being very dark and grim black comedies, one of which, O Conquistador (1928), touched on the subject of suicide. It was the late years of the Jazz Age, a time of unprecedented prosperity and boundless bonhomie, and the critics, and more critically, the ticket-buying public, rejected Harry. In 1928, First National did not pick up his contract. The Harry Langdon Corp. soon went bankrupt, and his career as the \"fourth major silent comedian\" was through, just as sound was coming in.)In April of 1927, Capra and his wife Helen split up, and Capra went off to New York to direct Filhos da Fortuna (1927) for First National, his first picture with Claudette Colbert. The director and his star did not get along, and the film went over budget. Subsequently, First National refused to pay Capra, and he had to hitchhike back to Hollywood. The film proved to be Capra's only genuine flop.By September 1927, he was back working as a writer for Mack Sennett, but in October, he was hired as a director by Columbia Pictures President and Production Chief Harry Cohn for $1,000. The event was momentous for both of them, for at Columbia Capra would soon become the #1 director in Hollywood in the 1930s, and the success of Capra's films would propel the Poverty Row studio into the major leagues. But at first, Cohn was displeased with him. When viewing the first three days of rushes of his first Columbia film, That Certain Thing (1928), Cohn wanted to fire him as everything on the first day had been shot in long shot, on the second day in medium shot, and on the third day in close-ups.\"I did it that way for time,\" Capra later recalled. \"It was so easy to be better than the other directors, because they were all dopes. They would shoot a long shot, then they would have to change the setup to shoot a medium shot, then they would take their close-ups. Then they would come back and start over again. You lose time, you see, moving the cameras and the big goddamn lights. I said, 'I'll get all the long shots on that first set first, then all the medium shots, and then the close-ups.' I wouldn't shoot the whole scene each way unless it was necessary. If I knew that part of it was going to play in long shot, I wouldn't shoot that part in close-up. But the trick was not to move nine times, just to move three times. This saved a day, maybe two days.\"Cohn decided to stick with Capra (he was ultimately delighted at the picture and gave Capra a $1,500 bonus and upped his per-picture salary), and in 1928, Cohn raised his salary again, now to to $3,000 per picture after he made several successful pictures, including O Submarino (1928). Duas Gera\u00e7\u00f5es (1929), the first of a series of films with higher budgets to be directed by Capra, would prove to be his first sound film, when scenes were reshot for dialogue. In the summer of that year, he was introduced to a young widow, Lucille Warner Reyburn (who became Capra's second wife Lou Capra). He also met a transplanted stage actress, Barbara Stanwyck, who had been recruited for the talkie but had been in three successive unsuccessful films and wanted to return to the New York stage. Harry Cohn wanted Stanwyck to appear in Capra's planned film, A Flor dos Meus Sonhos (1930), but the interview with Capra did not go well, and Capra refused to use her.Stanwyck went home crying after being dismissed by Capra, and her husband, a furious Frank Fay, called Capra up. In his defense, Capra said that Stanwyck didn't seem to want the part. According to Capra's 1961 autobiography, \"The Name Above the Title,\" Fay said, \"Frank, she's young, and shy, and she's been kicked around out here. Let me show you a test she made at Warner's.\" After viewing her Warners' test for Segredo da Morte (1928), Capra became enthusiastic and urged Cohn to sign her. In January of 1930, Capra began shooting A Flor dos Meus Sonhos (1930) with Stanwyck in the lead. The movies the two made together in the early '30s established them both on their separate journeys towards becoming movieland legends. Though Capra would admit to falling in love with his leading lady, it was Lucille Warner Reyburn who became the second Mrs. Capra.\"You're wondering why I was at that party. That's my racket. I'm a party girl. Do you know what that is?\"Stanwyck played a working-class \"party girl\" hired as a model by the painter Jerry, who hails from a wealthy family. Capra had written the first draft of the movie before screenwriter Jo Swerling took over. Swerling thought the treatment was dreadful. According to Capra, Swerling told Harry Cohn, when he initially had approached about adapting the play \"Ladies of the Evening\" into Capra's next proposed film, \"I don't like Hollywood, I don't like you, and I certainly don't like this putrid piece of gorgonzola somebody gave me to read. It stunk when Belasco produced it as A Flor dos Meus Sonhos (1930), and it will stink as Ladies of Leisure, even if your little tin Jesus does direct it. The script is inane, vacuous, pompous, unreal, unbelievable - and incredibly dull.\"Capra, who favored extensive rehearsals before shooting a scene, developed his mature directorial style while collaborating with Stanwyck, a trained stage actress whose performance steadily deteriorated after rehearsals or retakes. Stanwyck's first take in a scene usually was her best. Capra started blocking out scenes in advance, and carefully preparing his other actors so that they could react to Stanwyck in the first shot, whose acting often was unpredictable, so they wouldn't foul up the continuity. In response to this semi-improvisatory style, Capra's crew had to boost its level of craftsmanship to beyond normal Hollywood standards, which were forged in more static and prosaic work conditions. Thus, the professionalism of Capra's crews became better than those of other directors. Capra's philosophy for his crew was, \"You guys are working for the actors, they're not working for you.\"After \"Ladies of Leisure,\" Capra was assigned to direct Loura e Sedutora (1931) starring Jean Harlow. The script had been the product of a series of writers, including Jo Swerling (who was given credit for adaptation), but was polished by Capra and Robert Riskin (who was given screen credit for the dialogue). Along with Jo Swerling, Riskin would rank as one of Capra's most important collaborators, ultimately having a hand in 13 movies. (Riskin wrote nine screenplays for Capra, and Capra based four other films on Riskin's work.)Riskin created a hard-boiled newspaperman, Stew Smith for the film, a character his widow, the actress Fay Wray, said came closest to Riskin of any character he wrote. A comic character, the wise-cracking reporter who wants to lampoon high society but finds himself hostage to the pretensions of the rich he had previously mocked is the debut of the prototypical \"Capra\" hero. The dilemma faced by Stew, akin to the immigrant's desire to assimilate but being rejected by established society, was repeated in O Galante Mr. Deeds (1936) and in Ador\u00e1vel Vagabundo (1941).Capra, Stanwyck, Riskin and Jo Swerling all were together to create Capra's next picture, A Mulher Miraculosa (1931), a story about a shady evangelist. With John Meehan, Riskin wrote the play that the movie is based on, \"Bless You, Sister,\" and there is a possibly apocryphal story that has Riskin at a story conference at which Capra relates the treatment for the proposed film. Capra, finished, asked Riskin for his input, and Riskin replied, \"I wrote that play. My brother and I were stupid enough to produce it on Broadway. It cost us almost every cent we had. If you intend to make a picture of it, it only proves one thing: You're even more stupid than we were.\"Jo Swerling adapted Riskin's play, which he and his brother Everett patterned after Sinclair Lewis' \"Elmer Gantry.\" Like the Lewis novel, the play focuses on the relationship between a lady evangelist and a con man. The difference, though, is that the nature of the relationship is just implied in Riskin's play (and the Capra film). There is also the addition of the blind war-vet as the moral conscience of the story; he is the pivotal character, whereas in Lewis' tale, the con artist comes to have complete control over the evangelist after eventually seducing her. Like some other Capra films, A Mulher Miraculosa (1931) is about the love between a romantic, idealizing man and a cynical, bitter woman. Riskin had based his character on lady evangelist Uldine Utley, while Stanwyck based her characterization on Aimee Semple McPherson.Recognizing that he had something in his star director, Harry Cohn took full advantage of the lowly position his studio had in Hollywood. Both Warner Brothers and mighty MGM habitually lent Cohn their troublesome stars -- anyone rejecting scripts or demanding a pay raise was fodder for a loan out to Cohn's Poverty Row studio. Cohn himself was habitually loathe to sign long-term stars in the early 1930s (although he made rare exceptions to Peter Lorre and The Three Stooges) and was delighted to land the talents of any top flight star and invariably assigned them to Capra's pictures. Most began their tenure in purgatory with trepidation but left eagerly wanting to work with Capra again.In 1932, Capra decided to make a motion picture that reflected the social conditions of the day. He and Riskin wrote the screenplay for Loucura Americana (1932), a melodrama that is an important precursor to later Capra films, not only with A Felicidade N\u00e3o se Compra (1946) which shares the plot device of a bank run, but also in the depiction of the irrationality of a crowd mentality and the ability of the individual to make a difference. In the movie, an idealistic banker is excoriated by his conservative board of directors for making loans to small businesses on the basis of character rather than on sounder financial criteria. Since the Great Depression is on, and many people lack collateral, it would be impossible to productively lend money on any other criteria than character, the banker argues. When there is a run on the bank due to a scandal, it appears that the board of directors are rights the bank depositors make a run on the bank to take out their money before the bank fails. The fear of a bank failure ensures that the failure will become a reality as a crowd mentality takes over among the client\u00e8le. The board of directors refuse to pledge their capital to stave off the collapse of the bank, but the banker makes a plea to the crowd, and just like George Bailey's depositors in A Felicidade N\u00e3o se Compra (1946), the bank is saved as the fears of the crowd are ameliorated and businessmen grateful to the banker pledge their capital to save the bank. The board of directors, impressed by the banker's character and his belief in the character of his individual clients (as opposed to the irrationality of the crowd), pledge their capital and the bank run is staved off and the bank is saved.In his biography, \"The Name Above the Picture,\" Capra wrote that before Loucura Americana (1932), he had only made \"escapist\" pictures with no basis in reality. He recounts how Poverty Row studios, lacking stars and production values, had to resort to \"gimmick\" movies to pull the crowds in, making films on au courant controversial subjects that were equivalent to \"yellow journalism.\"What was more important than the subject and its handling was the maturation of Capra's directorial style with the film. Capra had become convinced that the mass-experience of watching a motion picture with an audience had the psychological effect in individual audience members of slowing down the pace of a film. A film that during shooting and then when viewed on a movieola editing device and on a small screen in a screening room among a few professionals that had seemed normally paced became sluggish when projected on the big screen. While this could have been the result of the projection process blowing up the actors to such large proportions, Capra ultimately believed it was the effect of mass psychology affecting crowds since he also noticed this \"slowing down\" phenomenon at ball games and at political conventions. Since Loucura Americana (1932) dealt with crowds, he feared that the effect would be magnified.He decided to boost the pace of the film, during the shooting. He did away with characters' entrances and exits that were a common part of cinematic \"grammar\" in the early 1930s, a survival of the \"photoplays\" days. Instead, he \"jumped\" characters in and out of scenes, and jettisoned the dissolves that were also part of cinematic grammar that typically ended scenes and indicated changes in time or locale so as not to make cutting between scenes seem choppy to the audience. Dialogue was deliberately overlapped, a radical innovation in the early talkies, when actors were instructed to let the other actor finish his or her lines completely before taking up their cue and beginning their own lines, in order to facilitate the editing of the sound-track. What he felt was his greatest innovation was to boost the pacing of the acting in the film by a third by making a scene that would normally play in one minute take only 40 seconds.When all these innovations were combined in his final cut, it made the movie seem normally paced on the big screen, though while shooting individual scenes, the pacing had seemed exaggerated. It also gave the film a sense of urgency that befitted the subject of a financial panic and a run on a bank. More importantly, it \"kept audience attention riveted to the screen,\" as he said in his autobiography. Except for \"mood pieces,\" Capra subsequently used these techniques in all his films, and he was amused by critics who commented on the \"naturalness\" of his direction.Capra was close to completely establishing his themes and style. Justly accused of indulging in sentiment which some critics labeled \"Capra-corn,\" Capra's next film, Dama por um Dia (1933) was an adaptation of Damon Runyon's 1929 short story \"Madame La Gimp\" about a nearly destitute apple peddler whom the superstitious gambler Dave the Dude (portrayed by Warner Brothers star Warren William) sets up in high style so she and her daughter, who is visiting with her finance, will not be embarrassed. Dave the Dude believes his luck at gambling comes from his ritualistically buying an apple a day from Annie, who is distraught and considering suicide to avoid the shame of her daughter seeing her reduced to living on the street. The Dude and his criminal confederates put Annie up in a luxury apartment with a faux husband in order to establish Annie in the eyes of her daughter as a dignified and respectable woman, but in typical Runyon fashion, Annie becomes more than a fake as the masquerade continues.Robert Riskin wrote the first four drafts of Dama por um Dia (1933), and of all the scripts he worked on for Capra, the film deviates less from the script than any other. After seeing the movie, Runyon sent a telegraph to Riskin praising him for his success at elaborating on the story and fleshing out the characters while maintain his basic story. Dama por um Dia (1933) was the favorite Capra film of John Ford, the great filmmaker who once directed the unknown extra. The movie cost $300,000 and was the first of Capra's oeuvre to attract the attention of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences, getting a Best Director nomination for Capra, plus nods for Riskin and Best Actress. The movie received Columbia's first Best Picture nomination, the studio never having attracted any attention from the Academy before Dama por um Dia (1933). (Capra's last film was the flop remake of Dama por um Dia (1933) with Bette Davis and Glenn Ford, Dama por um Dia (1961))Capra reunited with Stanwyck and produced his first universally acknowledged classic, O \u00daltimo Ch\u00e1 do General Yen (1932), a film that now seems to belong more to the oeuvre of Josef von Sternberg than it does to Frank Capra. With \"General Yen,\" Capra had consciously set out to make a movie that would win Academy Awards. Frustrated that the innovative, timely, and critically well-received Loucura Americana (1932) had not received any recognition at the Oscars (particularly in the director's category in recognition of his innovations in pacing), he vented his displeasure to Columbia boss Cohn.\"Forget it,\" Cohn told Capra, as recounted in his autobiography. \"You ain't got a Chinaman's chance. They only vote for that arty junk.\"Capra set out to boost his chances by making an arty film featuring a \"Chinaman\" that confronted that major taboo of American cinema of the first half of the century, miscegenation.In the movie, the American missionary Megan Davis is in China to marry another missionary. Abducted by the Chinese Warlord General Yen, she is torn away from the American compound that kept her isolated from the Chinese and finds herself in a strange, dangerous culture. The two fall in love despite their different races and life-views. The film ran up against the taboo against miscegenation embedded in the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors Association's Production Code, and while Megan merely kisses General Yen's hand in the picture, the fact that she was undeniably in love with a man from a different race attracted the vituperation of many bigots.Having fallen for Megan, General Yen engenders her escape back to the Americans before willingly drinking a poisoned cup of tea, his involvement with her having cost him his army, his wealth, and now his desire to live. O \u00daltimo Ch\u00e1 do General Yen (1932) marks the introduction of suicide as a Capra theme that will come back repeatedly, most especially in George Bailey's breakdown on the snowy bridge in A Felicidade N\u00e3o se Compra (1946).Despair often shows itself in Capra films, and although in his post-\"General Yen\" work, the final reel wraps things up in a happy way, until that final reel, there is tragedy, cynicism, heartless exploitation, and other grim subject matter that Capra's audiences must have known were the truth of the world, but that were too grim to face when walking out of a movie theater. When pre-Code movies were rediscovered and showcased across the United States in the 1990s, they were often accompanied by thesis about how contemporary audiences \"read\" the films (and post-1934 more Puritanical works), as the movies were not so frank or racy as supposed. There was a great deal of signaling going on which the audience could read into, and the same must have been true for Capra's films, giving lie to the fact that he was a sentimentalist with a saccharine view of America. There are few films as bitter as those of Frank Capra before the final reel.Despair was what befell Frank Capra, personally, on the night of March 16, 1934, which he attended as one of the Best Director nominees for Dama por um Dia (1933). Capra had caught Oscar fever, and in his own words, \"In the interim between the nominations and the final voting...my mind was on those Oscars.\" When Oscar host Will Rogers opened the envelope for Best Director, he commented, \"Well, well, well. What do you know. I've watched this young man for a long time. Saw him come up from the bottom, and I mean the bottom. It couldn't have happened to a nicer guy. Come on up and get it, Frank!\"Capra got up to go get it, squeezing past tables and making his way to the open dance floor to accept his Oscar. \"The spotlight searched around trying to find me. 'Over here!' I waved. Then it suddenly swept away from me -- and picked up a flustered man standing on the other side of the dance floor - Frank Lloyd!\"Frank Lloyd went up to the dais to accept HIS Oscar while a voice in back of Capra yelled, \"Down in front!\"Capra's walk back to his table amidst shouts of \"Sit down!\" turned into the \"Longest, saddest, most shattering walk in my life. I wished I could have crawled under the rug like a miserable worm. When I slumped in my chair I felt like one. All of my friends at the table were crying.\"That night, after Lloyd's Cavalgada (1933), beat Dama por um Dia (1933) for Best Picture, Capra got drunk at his house and passed out. \"Big 'stupido,'\" Capra thought to himself, \"running up to get an Oscar dying with excitement, only to crawl back dying with shame. Those crummy Academy voters; to hell with their lousy awards. If ever they did vote me one, I would never, never, NEVER show up to accept it.\"Capra would win his first of three Best Director Oscars the next year, and would show up to accept it. More importantly, he would become the president of the Academy in 1935 and take it out of the labor relations field a time when labor strife and the formation of the talent guilds threatened to destroy it.The International Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences had been the brainchild of Louis B. Mayer in 1927 (it dropped the \"International\" soon after its formation). In order to forestall unionization by the creative talent (directors, actors and screenwriters) who were not covered by the Basic Agreement signed in 1926, Mayer had the idea of forming a company union, which is how the Academy came into being. The nascent Screen Writers Union, which had been created in 1920 in Hollywood, had never succeeded in getting a contract from the studios. It went out of existence in 1927, when labor relations between writers and studios were handled by the Academy's writers' branch.The Academy had brokered studio-mandated pay-cuts of 10% in 1927 and 1931, and massive layoffs in 1930 and 1931. With the inauguration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt on March 4, 1933, Roosevelt took no time in attempting to tackle the Great Depression. The day after his inauguration, he declared a National Bank Holiday, which hurt the movie industry as it was heavily dependent on bank loans. Louis B. Mayer, as president of the Association of Motion Picture Producers, Inc. (the co-equal arm of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors Association charged with handling labor relations) huddled with a group from the Academy (the organization he created and had long been criticized for dominating, in both labor relations and during the awards season) and announced a 50% across-the-board pay cut. In response, stagehands called a strike for March 13th, which shut down every studio in Hollywood.After another caucus between Mayer and the Academy committee, a proposal for a pay-cut on a sliding-scale up to 50% for everyone making over $50 a week; which would only last for eight weeks, was inaugurated. Screen writers resigned en masse from the Academy and joined a reformed Screen Writers Guild, but most employees had little choice and went along with it. All the studios but Warner Bros. and Sam Goldwyn honored the pledge to restore full salaries after the eight weeks, and Warners production chief Darryl F. Zanuck resigned in protest over his studio's failure to honor its pledge. A time of bad feelings persisted, and much anger was directed towards the Academy in its role as company union.The Academy, trying to position itself as an independent arbiter, hired the accounting firm of Price Waterhouse for the first time to inspect the books of the studios. The audit revealed that all the studios were solvent, but Harry Warner refused to budge and Academy President 'Conrad Nagel' resigned, although some said he was forced out after a vote of no-confidence after arguing Warner's case. The Academy announced that the studio bosses would never again try to impose a horizontal salary cut, but the usefulness of the Academy as a company union was over.Under Roosevelt's New Deal, the self-regulation imposed by the National Industrial Relations Act (signed into law on June 16th) to bring business sectors back to economic health was predicated upon cartelization, in which the industry itself wrote its own regulatory code. With Hollywood, it meant the re-imposition of paternalistic labor relations that the Academy had been created to wallpaper over. The last nail in the company union's coffin was when it became public knowledge that the Academy appointed a committee to investigate the continued feasibility of the industry practice of giving actors and writers long-term contracts. High salaries to directors, actors, and screen writers was compensation to the creative people for producers refusing to ceded control over creative decision-making. Long-term contracts were the only stability in the Hollywood economic set-up up creative people,. Up to 20%-25% of net earnings of the movie industry went to bonuses to studio owners, production chiefs, and senior executives at the end of each year, and this created a good deal of resentment that fueled the militancy of the SWG and led to the formation of the Screen Actors Guild in July 1933 when they, too, felt that the Academy had sold them out.The industry code instituted a cap on the salaries of actors, directors, and writers, but not of movie executives; mandated the licensing of agents by producers; and created a reserve clause similar to baseball where studios had renewal options with talent with expired contracts, who could only move to a new studio if the studio they had last been signed to did not pick up their option.The SWG sent a telegram to FDR in October 1933 denouncing this policy, arguing that the executives had taken millions of dollars of bonuses while running their companies into receivership and bankruptcy. The SWG denounced the continued membership of executives who had led their studios into financial failure remaining on the corporate boards and in the management of the reorganized companies, and furthermore protested their use of the NIRA to write their corrupt and failed business practices into law at the expense of the workers.There was a mass resignation of actors from the Academy in October 1933, with the actors switching their allegiance to SAG. SAG joined with the SWG to publish \"The Screen Guilds Magazine,\" a periodical whose editorial content attacked the Academy as a company union in the producers' pocket. SAG President Eddie Cantor, a friend of Roosevelt who had bee invited to spend the Thanksgiving Day holiday with the president, informed him of the guild's grievances over the NIRA code. Roosevelt struck down many of the movie industry code's anti-labor provisions by executive order.The labor battles between the guilds and the studios would continue until the late 1930s, and by the time Frank Capra was elected president of the Academy in 1935, the post was an unenviable one. The Screen Directors Guild was formed at King Vidor's house on January 15, 1936, and one of its first acts was to send a letter to its members urging them to boycott the Academy Awards ceremony, which was three days away. None of the guilds had been recognized as bargaining agents by the studios, and it was argued to grace the Academy Awards would give the Academy, a company union, recognition. Academy membership had declined to 40 from a high of 600, and Capra believed that the guilds wanted to punish the studios financially by depriving them of the good publicity the Oscars generated.But the studios couldn't care less. Seeing that the Academy was worthless to help them in its attempts to enforce wage cuts, it too abandoned the Academy, which it had financed. Capra and the Board members had to pay for the Oscar statuettes for the 1936 ceremony. In order to counter the boycott threat, Capra needed a good publicity gimmick himself, and the Academy came up with one, voting D.W. Griffith an honorary Oscar, the first bestowed since one had been given to Charles Chaplin at the first Academy Awards ceremony.The Guilds believed the boycott had worked as only 20 SAG members and 13 SWG members had showed up at the Oscars, but Capra remembered the night as a victory as all the winners had shown up. However, 'Variety' wrote that \"there was not the galaxy of stars and celebs in the director and writer groups which distinguished awards banquets in recent years.\" \"Variety\" reported that to boost attendance, tickets had been given to secretaries and the like. Bette Davis and Victor McLaglen had showed up to accept their Oscars, but McLaglen's director and screenwriter, John Ford and Dudley Nichols, both winners like McLaglen for O Delator (1935), were not there, and Nichols became the first person to refuse an Academy Award when he sent back his statuette to the Academy with a note saying he would not turn his back on his fellow writers in the SWG. Capra sent it back to him. Ford, the treasurer of the SDG, had not showed up to accept his Oscar, he explained, because he wasn't a member of the Academy. When Capra staged a ceremony where Ford accepted his award, the SDG voted him out of office.To save the Academy and the Oscars, Capra convinced the board to get it out of the labor relations field. He also democratized the nomination process to eliminate studio politics, opened the cinematography and interior decoration awards to films made outside the U.S., and created two new acting awards for supporting performances to win over SAG.By the 1937 awards ceremony, SAG signaled its pleasure that the Academy had mostly stayed out of labor relations by announcing it had no objection to its members attending the awards ceremony. The ceremony was a success, despite the fact that the Academy had to charge admission due to its poor finances. Frank Capra had saved the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and he even won his second Oscar that night, for directing O Galante Mr. Deeds (1936). At the end of the evening, Capra announced the creation of the Irving Thalberg Memorial Award to honor \"the most consistent high level of production achievement by an individual producer.\" It was an award he himself was not destined to win.By the 1938 awards, the Academy and all three guilds had buried the hatchet, and the guild presidents all attended the ceremony: SWG President Dudley Nichols, who finally had accepted his Oscar, SAG President Robert Montgomery, and SDG President King Vidor. Capra also had introduced the secret ballot, the results of which were unknown to everyone but the press, who were informed just before the dinner so they could make their deadlines. The first Irving Thalberg Award was given to long-time Academy supporter and anti-Guild stalwart Darryl F. Zanuck by Cecil B. DeMille, who in his preparatory remarks, declared that the Academy was \"now free of all labor struggles.\"But those struggles weren't over. In 1939, Capra had been voted president of the SDG and began negotiating with AMPP President 'Joseph Schenck', the head of 20th Century-Fox, for the industry to recognize the SDG as the sole collective bargaining agent for directors. When Schenck refused, Capra mobilized the directors and threatened a strike. He also threatened to resign from the Academy and mount a boycott of the awards ceremony, which was to be held a week later. Schenck gave in, and Capra won another victory when he was named Best Director for a third time at the Academy Awards, and his movie, Do Mundo Nada se Leva (1938), was voted Best Picture of 1938.The 1940 awards ceremony was the last that Capra presided over, and he directed a documentary about them, which was sold to Warner Bros' for $30,000, the monies going to the Academy. He was nominated himself for Best Director and Best Picture for A Mulher Faz o Homem (1939), but lost to the ...E o Vento Levou (1939) juggernaut. Under Capra's guidance, the Academy had left the labor relations field behind in order to concentrated on the awards (publicity for the industry), research and education.\"I believe the guilds should more or less conduct the operations and functions of this institution,\" he said in his farewell speech. He would be nominated for Best Director and Best Picture once more with A Felicidade N\u00e3o se Compra (1946) in 1947, but the Academy would never again honor him, not even with an honorary award after all his service. (Bob Hope, in contrast, received four honorary awards, including a lifetime membership in 1945, and the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian award in 1960 from the Academy.) The SDG (subsequently renamed the Directors Guild of America after its 1960 with the Radio and Television Directors Guild and which Capra served as its first president from 1960-61), the union he had struggled with in the mid-1930s but which he had first served as president from 1939 to 1941 and won it recognition, voted him a lifetime membership in 1941 and a Lifetime Achievement Award in 1959.Whenever Capra convinced studio boss Harry Cohn to let him make movies with more controversial or ambitious themes, the movies typically lost money after under-performing at the box office. O \u00daltimo Ch\u00e1 do General Yen (1932) and Horizonte Perdido (1937) were both expensive, philosophically minded pictures that sought to reposition Capra and Columbia into the prestige end of the movie market. After the former's relative failure at the box office and with critics, Capra turned to making a screwball comedy, a genre he excelled at, with Aconteceu Naquela Noite (1934). Bookended with Do Mundo Nada se Leva (1938), these two huge hits won Columbia Best Picture Oscars and Capra Best Director Academy Awards. These films, along with O Galante Mr. Deeds (1936), A Mulher Faz o Homem (1939), and A Felicidade N\u00e3o se Compra (1946) are the heart of Capra's cinematic canon. They are all classics and products of superb craftsmanship, but they gave rise to the canard of \"Capra-corn.\" One cannot consider Capra without taking into account O \u00daltimo Ch\u00e1 do General Yen (1932), Loucura Americana (1932), and Ador\u00e1vel Vagabundo (1941), all three dark films tackling major issues, Imperialism, the American plutocracy, and domestic fascism. Capra was no Pollyanna, and the man who was called a \"dago\" by Mack Sennett and who went on to become one of the most unique, highly honored and successful directors, whose depictions of America are considered Americana themselves, did not live his cinematic life looking through a rose-colored range-finderIn his autobiography \"The Name Above the Title,\" Capra says that at the time of Loucura Americana (1932), critics began commenting on his \"gee-whiz\" style of filmmaking. The critics attacked \"gee whiz\" cultural artifacts as their fabricators \"wander about wide-eyed and breathless, seeing everything as larger than life.\" Capra's response was \"Gee whiz!\"Defining Hollywood as split between two camps, \"Mr. Up-beat\" and \"Mr. Down-beat,\" Capra defended the up-beat gee whiz on the grounds that, \"To some of us, all that meets the eye IS larger than life, including life itself. Who ca match the wonder of it?\"Among the artists of the \"Gee-Whiz:\" school were Ernest Hemingway, Homer, and Paul Gauguin, a novelist who lived a heroic life larger than life itself, a poet who limned the lives of gods and heroes, and a painter who created a mythic Tahiti, the Tahiti that he wanted to find. Capra pointed to Moses and the apostles as examples of men who were larger than life. Capra was proud to be \"Mr. Up-beat\" rather than belong to \"the 'ashcan' school\" whose \"films depict life as an alley of cats clawing lids off garbage cans, and man as less noble than a hyena. The 'ash-canners,' in turn, call us Pollyannas, mawkish sentimentalists, and corny happy-enders.\"What really moves Capra is that in America, there was room for both schools, that there was no government interference that kept him from making a film like Loucura Americana (1932). (While Ambassador to the Court of St. James, Joseph P. Kennedy had asked Harry Cohn to stop exporting A Mulher Faz o Homem (1939) to Europe as it portrayed American democracy so negatively.) About Mr. Up-beat and Mr-Downbeat and \"Mr. In-between,\" Capra says, \"We all respect and admire each other because the great majority freely express their own individual artistry unfettered by subsidies or strictures from government, pressure groups, or ideologists.\"In the period 1934 to 1941, Capra the created the core of his canon with the classics Aconteceu Naquela Noite (1934), O Galante Mr. Deeds (1936), Do Mundo Nada se Leva (1938), A Mulher Faz o Homem (1939) and Ador\u00e1vel Vagabundo (1941), wining three Best Director Oscars in the process. Some cine-historians call Capra the great American propagandist, he was so effective in creating an indelible impression of America in the 1930s. \"Maybe there never was an America in the thirties,\" John Cassavetes was quoted as saying. \"Maybe it was all Frank Capra.\"After the United States went to war in December 1941, Frank Capra rejoined the Army and became an actual propagandist. His \"Why We Fight\" series of propaganda films were highly lauded for their remarkable craftsmanship and were the best of the U.S. propaganda output during the war. Capra's philosophy, which has been variously described as a kind of Christian socialism (his films frequently feature a male protagonist who can be seen a Christ figure in a story about redemption emphasizing New Testament values) that is best understood as an expression of humanism, made him an ideal propagandist. He loved his adopted country with the fervor of the immigrant who had realized the American dream. One of his propaganda films, The Negro Soldier (1944), is a milestone in race relations.Capra, a genius in the manipulation of the first form of \"mass media,\" was opposed to \"massism.\" The crowd in a Capra film is invariably wrong, and he comes down on the side of the individual, who can make a difference in a society of free individuals. In an interview, Capra said he was against \"mass entertainment, mass production, mass education, mass everything. Especially mass man. I was fighting for, in a sense, the preservation of the liberty of the individual person against the mass.\"Capra had left Columbia after \"Mr. Smith\" and formed his own production company. After the war, he founded Liberty Films with John Ford and made his last masterpiece, A Felicidade N\u00e3o se Compra (1946). Liberty folded prior to its release (another Liberty film, William Wyler's masterpiece, Os Melhores Anos de Nossa Vida (1946) was released through United Artists). Though Capra received his sixth Oscar nomination as best director, the movie flopped at the box office, which is hard to believe now that the film is considered must-see viewing each Christmas. Capra's period of greatness was over, and after making three under-whelming films from 1948 to '51 (including a remake of his earlier A Vit\u00f3ria Ser\u00e1 Tua (1934)), Capra didn't direct another picture for eight years, instead making a series of memorable semi-comic science documentaries for television that became required viewing for most 1960's school kids. His last two movies, Os Vi\u00favos Tamb\u00e9m Sonham (1959) and Dama por um Dia (1961) his remake of Dama por um Dia (1933) did little to enhance his reputation.But a great reputation it was, and is. Capra's films withstood the test of time and continue to be as beloved as when they were embraced by the movie-going \"masses\" in the 1930s. It was the craftsmanship: Capra was undeniably a master of his medium. The great English novelist Graham Greene, who supported himself as a film critic in the 1930s, loved Capra's films due to their sense of responsibility and of common life, and due to his connection with his audience. (Capra, according to the 1938 \"Time\" article, believed that what he liked would be liked by moviegoers). In his review of O Galante Mr. Deeds (1936), Greene elucidated the central theme of Capra's movies: \"Goodness and simplicity manhandled in a deeply selfish and brutal world.\"But it was Capra's great mastery over film that was the key to his success. Comparing Capra to Dickens in a not wholly flattering review of Do Mundo Nada se Leva (1938), Green found Capra \"a rather muddled and sentimental idealist who feels -- vaguely -- that something is wrong with the social system\" (807). Commenting on the improbable scene in which Grandpa Vanderhof persuades the munitions magnate Anthony P. Kirby to give everything up and play the harmonica, Greene stated:\"It sounds awful, but it isn't as awful as all that, for Capra has a touch of genius with a camera: his screen always seems twice as big as other people's, and he cuts as brilliantly as Eisenstein (the climax when the big bad magnate takes up his harmonica is so exhilarating in its movement that you forget its absurdity). Humour and not wit is his line, a humor that shades off into whimsicality, and a kind of popular poetry which is apt to turn wistful. We may groan and blush as he cuts his way remorselessly through all finer values to the fallible human heart, but infallibly he makes his appeal - to that great soft organ with its unreliable goodness and easy melancholy and baseless optimism. The cinema, a popular craft, can hardly be expected to do more.\"Capra was a populist, and the simplicity of his narrative structures, in which the great social problems facing America were boiled down to scenarios in which metaphorical boy scouts took on corrupt political bosses and evil-minded industrialists, created mythical America of simple archetypes that with its humor, created powerful films that appealed to the elemental emotions of the audience. The immigrant who had struggled and been humiliated but persevere due to his inner resolution harnessed the mytho-poetic power of the movie to create proletarian passion plays that appealed to the psyche of the New Deal movie-goer. The country during the Depression was down but not out, and the ultimate success of the individual in the Capra films was a bracing tonic for the movie audience of the 1930s. His own personal history, transformed on the screen, became their myths that got them through the Depression, and when that and the war was over, the great filmmaker found himself out of time. Capra, like Charles Dickens, moralized political and economic issues. Both were primarily masters of personal and moral expression, and not of the social and political. It was the emotional realism, not the social realism, of such films as A Mulher Faz o Homem (1939), which he was concerned with, and by focusing on the emotional and moral issues his protagonists faced, typically dramatized as a conflict between cynicism and the protagonist's faith and idealism, that made the movies so powerful, and made them register so powerfully with an audience.\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Jon C.

His father was a stationery store owner and he had three siblings. During his late teen years, he went to Thomas Downey High School and was very much interested in drag racing. He planned to become a professional racecar driver. However, a terrible car accident just after his high school graduation ended that dream permanently. The accident changed his views on life.He decided to attend Modesto Junior College before enrolling in the University of Southern California film school. As a film student, he made several short films including Electronic Labyrinth THX 1138 4EB (1967) which won first prize at the 1967-68 National Student Film Festival. In 1967, he was awarded a scholarship by Warner Brothers to observe the making of O Caminho do Arco-\u00cdris (1968) which was being directed by Francis Ford Coppola. Lucas and Coppola became good friends and formed American Zoetrope in 1969. The company's first project was Lucas' full-length version of THX 1138 (1971). In 1971, Coppola went into production for O Poderoso Chef\u00e3o (1972), and Lucas formed his own company, Lucasfilm Ltd.In 1973, he wrote and directed the semiautobiographical Loucuras de Ver\u00e3o (1973) which won the Golden Globe and garnered five Academy Award nominations. This gave him the clout he needed for his next daring venture. From 1973 to 1974, he began writing the screenplay which became Star Wars, Epis\u00f3dio IV: Uma Nova Esperan\u00e7a (1977). He was inspired to make this movie from Flash Gordon and the Planet of the Apes films. In 1975, he established ILM. (Industrial Light & Magic) to produce the visual effects needed for the movie. Another company called Sprocket Systems was established to edit and mix Star Wars and later becomes known as Skywalker Sound. His movie was turned down by several studios until 20th Century Fox gave him a chance. Lucas agreed to forego his directing salary in exchange for 40% of the film's box-office take and all merchandising rights. The movie went on to break all box office records and earned seven Academy Awards. It redefined the term \"blockbuster\" and the rest is history.Lucas made the other Star Wars films and along with Steven Spielberg created the Indiana Jones series which made box office records of their own. From 1980 to 1985, Lucas was busy with the construction of Skywalker Ranch, built to accommodate the creative, technical, and administrative needs of Lucasfilm. Lucas also revolutionized movie theaters with the THX system which was created to maintain the highest quality standards in motion picture viewing.He went on to produce several more movies that have introduced major innovations in filmmaking technology. He is chairman of the board of the George Lucas Educational Foundation. In 1992, George Lucas was honored with the Irving G. Thalberg Award by the Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for his lifetime achievement.He reentered the directing chair with the production of the highly-anticipated Star Wars prequel trilogy beginning with Star Wars, Epis\u00f3dio I: A Amea\u00e7a Fantasma (1999) . The films have been polarizing for fans and critics alike, but were commercially successful and have become a part of culture. The animated spin-off series Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008) was supervised by Lucas. He sold Lucasfilm to Disney in 2012, making co-chair Kathleen Kennedy president. He has attended the premieres of new Star Wars films and been generally supportive of them.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Sujit R.

Matt has an older brother, Kyle, a sculptor. His father was of English and Scottish descent, and his mother is of Finnish and Swedish ancestry. The family lived in Newton until his parents divorced in 1973, when Damon and his brother moved with his mother to Cambridge. He grew up in a stable community, and was raised near actor Ben Affleck.Damon attended Cambridge Rindge and Latin School and he performed in a number of theater productions during his time there. He attended Harvard University as an English major. While in Harvard, he kept on skipping classes to pursue acting projects, which included the TNT original film, Rising Son (1990), and prep-school drama, C\u00f3digo de Honra (1992). It was until his film, Ger\u00f4nimo: Uma Lenda Americana (1993), was expected to be a big success that he decided to drop out of university completely. Arriving in Hollywood, Matt managed to get his first break with a part in the romantic comedy, Tr\u00eas Mulheres, Tr\u00eas Amores (1988). However, the film did not do too well and his film career failed to take off. Not letting failure discourage him from acting, he went for another audition, and managed to get a starring role in C\u00f3digo de Honra (1992). Up next for Matt was a role as a soldier who had problems with drug-addiction in the movie, Coragem sob Fogo (1996). Matt had, in fact, lost forty pounds for his role which resulted in health problems.The following year, he garnered accolades for G\u00eanio Indom\u00e1vel (1997), a screenplay he had originally written for an English class at Harvard University. G\u00eanio Indom\u00e1vel (1997) was nominated for 9 Academy Awards, one of which, Matt won for Best Original Screenplay along with Ben Affleck. In the year 1998, Matt played the title role in Steven Spielberg's film, O Resgate do Soldado Ryan (1998), which was one of the most acclaimed films in that year.

Sizemore grew up idolizing the tough-guy characters of the movies he watched. After attending Wayne State University, he got his master's degree in theatre from Temple University in 1986.Like many, he moved to New York City and struggled, waiting tables and performing in plays. His first break came when Oliver Stone cast him in a bit part in Nascido em 4 de Julho (1989). Bigger roles soon followed throughout the early 1990s, such as Culpado por Suspeita (1991), Amor \u00e0 Queima Roupa (1993), and Zona de Perigo (1993). 1994 proved to be an even bigger year for Sizemore, as he won the role of \"Bat Masterson\" in Kevin Costner's star-studded biopic Wyatt Earp (1994), as well as one of his first truly memorable roles as \"Detective Jack Scagnetti\" in Oliver Stone's controversial Assassinos por Natureza (1994). In 1995 he appeared in O Diabo Veste Azul (1995), Estranhos Prazeres (1995), as well as the acclaimed crime epic Fogo Contra Fogo (1995), directed by Michael Mann. Sizemore's first big leading role is in A Rel\u00edquia (1997), the big-budget effects thriller directed by Peter Hyams.According to a 2001 interview in The Calgary Sun, Sizemore entered a drug rehabilitation program in 1998 after his mother and his friend Robert De Niro appeared on his door-step during the filming of Witness to the Mob (1998). Telling him they were there to drive him to jail or to rehabilitation, Sizemore chose the latter. After completing rehabilitation, he counseled adolescents involved in substance abuse.Offered roles in W.W.II films directed by both Terrence Malick and Steven Spielberg, Sizemore chose the role of \"Sergeant Horvath\" in O Resgate do Soldado Ryan (1998). The role and film received wide acclaim and introduced Sizemore's talents to a much broader audience in a more human and well-rounded role than he had previously been given. Sizemore also credits this shoot and Steven Spielberg for helping him with his recovery from addiction, with Steven Spielberg threatening to reshoot the entire film if Sizemore failed a drug test even once.After a flamboyant and uncredited mobster role in Inimigo do Estado (1998), Sizemore then portrayed a psychotic paramedic in Vivendo no Limite (1999) directed by Martin Scorsese. Seemingly taking it easy, he then turned in fine but stereotypical performances in Por uma Boa Briga (1999), Planeta Vermelho (2000), and Pearl Harbor (2001). Sizemore then received another leading role in the high-profile military drama Falc\u00e3o Negro em Perigo (2001) directed by yet another legendary director, Ridley Scott.Specializing in the sort of ultimate tough-guy/manly man roles that hearken back to a different era in film, Sizemore continues to be a favourite of Hollywood's greatest directors. Never afraid to speak his mind about anyone and anything, his sense of blunt honesty and lack of pretension is refreshing. A commanding voice and presence on film, Sizemore looks to continue as one of Hollywood's greatest actors.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Brian Stewart\n          \n\n", "realName": "Thomas Edward Sizemore Jr.", "height": "180"},

He is the second of three children of Molly (McKenna), who worked for the Federal Aviation Administration at Kennedy Airport, and Edward J. Burns, a police sergeant and active spokesperson for the New York Police Dept. He was raised Catholic, and is of Irish, and one eighth Swedish, descent. Edward, along with his older sister, Mary, and brother, Brian, were raised in Long Island. He attended Catholic Chaminade High School before transferring to a public high school. He went on to attend The State University of New York at Albany and Oneonta College in New York to major in English literature. During his junior year he transferred to Hunter College in Manhattan, studied filmmaking and began writing the first of many short films.Upon graduating, and through his father's connections, he secured a job at Entertainment Tonight (1981) (TV) in 1993 working at as a \"go-fer\". There he was able to finance and begin working on Os Irm\u00e3os McMullen (1995), a comedy focusing on the trials and tribulations facing three Irish-Catholic siblings. It was shot primarily in his parents' Long Island home with a cast of unknowns including Burns himself and his then-girlfriend Maxine Bahns. The feature was filmed over eight months' time with a reported budget of only $ 30,000. Rejected by a series of distributors, Os Irm\u00e3os McMullen (1995) bowed at Sundance, after Burns had given Robert Redford a copy of the film while working on ET. In 1995 his film won the festival's Grand Jury Prize, becoming one of the most successful independent efforts of the year. He then sold the film to 20th Century Fox's Searchlight Pictures.For his follow-up Burn's wrote and directed Nosso Tipo de Mulher (1996), which retained much of McMullen's cast and crew, including girlfriend Maxine. He was also able to cast up-and-coming stars Jennifer Aniston and Cameron Diaz in pivotal roles, with original music from rocker Petty, Tom. Filmed with a larger budget of almost $3 million, the romantic comedy successfully premiered during the summer of 1996 . Burns soon began work on his third feature, _No Looking Back_, a romantic drama set in a coastal town's working-class community. Burn's career seemed to be flourishing, but his personal relationship with Bahns, to whom he became engaged, ended after eight years. During filming of Uma Chance para Ser Feliz (1998), there were reported romantic sightings with Burns and his co-star Lauren Holly. The relationship seemed to end when the film was released in 1998. That same year, Burns co-starred in the Steven Spielberg World War II epic O Resgate do Soldado Ryan (1998). After that pivotal role in one of the greatest films of all time, Burns continued a good year, and a new relationship with Heather Graham. In an interview with USA Weekly Magazine, Heather stated they met in a bar in LA, exchanged numbers and had numerous conversations. Burns then flew back to New York and she flew to east to see him a month later. Soon after Burns and Heather were seen at many premieres and events. It was also reported that couple was living together. But their relationship ended after two years. Although they were dating during the filming of his next project 15 Minutos (2001) starring along side Robert De Niro, Burns attended the premiere with none other than Christy Turlington. While his next few films did not make much of a dent in the box office including his film Paix\u00f5es em Nova York (2001), which co-starred Heather Graham. His relationship with Christy was getting hot and heavy. The couple got engaged in 2001. It was then reported their engagement was called off, but the couple reunited after a 7-month split. Burns and Christy finally married on June 7, 2003 and welcomed their first child Grace, later that year Grace, on October 25. Burns' most recent projects include writing and directing Noivo em Fuga (2006) and Segunda Chance para o Amor (2007). He welcomed his second child, son Finn, (Feb/2006) with wife Christy.Burns is committed to writing and directing his own films.

For her role as \"Emily Hartley\", wife of psychologist \"Bob Hartley\" (played by Bob Newhart), Pleshette was nominated for the Emmy Award twice, in 1977 and 1978. She was also nominated for an Emmy in 1962 for a guest appearance on the TV series, Dr. Kildare (1961) and, in 1991, for playing the title role in Leona Helmsley, a Rainha da Maldade (1990) in a 1990 TV movie. Her acting career lasted almost 50 years. Suzanne Pleshette was born on January 31, 1937, in New York, New York, to Eugene Pleshette, a TV network executive who had managed the Paramount theaters in Manhattan and Brooklyn during the Big Band era, and the former Geraldine Kaplan, a dancer who performed under the name Geraldine Rivers. Her paternal grandparents were Russian Jewish immigrants, and her maternal grandparents were Jewish immigrants from Austria-Hungary and Russia.Pleshette claims that she was not an acting natural but just \"found\" herself attending New York City's High School of the Performing Arts. After graduating from high school, she attended Syracuse University for a semester before returning to New York City to attend Finch College, an elite finishing school for well-to-do young ladies. After a semester at Finch, Pleshette dropped out to take lessons from famed acting teacher Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse. She made her Broadway debut in 1957 as part of the supporting cast for the play Estranha Obsess\u00e3o (1959). Initially cast as \"The Fourth Girl\", she eventually took over the ing\u00e9nue role during the play's run.Blessed with beauty, a fine figure, and a husky voice that made her seem older than her years, she quickly achieved success on both the small and big screens. She made her TV debut, at age 20, in Harbormaster (1957), then was chosen as the female lead opposite superstar Jerry Lewis in his 1958 comedy, O Rei dos M\u00e1gicos (1958). On Broadway, she replaced Anne Bancroft in the Broadway hit O Milagre de Anne Sullivan (1962).Once Pleshette started acting, her career never lagged until she was afflicted with cancer. Her most famous cinematic role was in Alfred Hitchcock's classic, Os P\u00e1ssaros (1963), as the brunette schoolteacher jilted by the hero of the film, \"Mitch Brenner\" (played by Rod Taylor). Pleshette's warm, earthy character was a perfect contrast to the icy blonde beauty, \"Melanie Daniels\" (Tippi Hedren). But it is for \"Emily Hartley\" that she'll be best remembered.After The Bob Newhart Show (1972) ceased production, Suzanne Pleshette worked regularly on television, mostly in TV movies. Although she was a talented dramatic actress, she had a flair for comedy and, in 1984, she headlined her own series at CBS, which had aired \"The Bob Newhart Show\". She helped develop the half-hour sitcom, and even had the rare honor of having her name in the title. Suzanne Pleshette Is Maggie Briggs (1984), however, was not a success. She co-starred with Hal Linden in another short-lived CBS TV series, \"The Boys Are Back\", in the 1994-95 season, then had recurring roles in the TV series Good Morning, Miami (2002) and 8 Regrinhas B\u00e1sicas (2002).Pleshette was married three times: In 1964, she wed teen idol Troy Donahue, her co-star in the 1962 film O Candelabro Italiano (1962) and in 1964's Um Clarim ao Longe (1964), but the marriage lasted less than a year. By contrast, her union with Texas oil millionaire, Tom Gallagher, lasted from 1968 until his death in 2000. After becoming a widow, she and widower Tom Poston (a Newhart regular) rekindled an old romance they had enjoyed when appearing together in \"The Golden Fleecing\", a 1959 Broadway comedy. They were married from 2001 until Poston's death, in April 2007.Pleshette was diagnosed with lung cancer and underwent chemotherapy in the summer of 2006; she rallied, but in late 2007, she barely survived a bout of pneumonia. She died of respiratory failure on Saturday, January 19, 2008, a few days shy of her 71st birthday. Suzanne Pleshette, the actress who achieved television immortality in her role as Bob Newhart's wife in the 1970s classic situation-comedy, The Bob Newhart Show (1972), will be remembered as a gregarious, down-to-earth person who loved to talk and often regaled her co-stars with a naughty story. Newhart and his producers had picked her for the role of \"Emily\" in \"The Bob Newhart Show\" after watching her appearances with Johnny Carson on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962), where she showed herself to be a first-rate raconteuse. Because she could hold her own with Newhart's friend Carson, they thought she would be a perfect foil as Newhart's TV wife.She accepted the part, and TV history was made.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Jon C.

The entertaining plots, compelling characters, and breathtaking animation in his films have earned him international renown from critics as well as public recognition within Japan. The Walt Disney Company's commitment to introduce the films to the rest of the world will let more people appreciate the high-quality works he has given the movie-going public.Hayao Miyazaki was born in T\u00f4ky\u00f4 on January 5, 1941. He started his career in 1963 as an animator at the studio Toei Douga studio, and was subsequently involved in many early classics of Japanese animation. From the beginning, he commanded attention with his incredible drawing ability and the seemingly endless stream of movie ideas he proposed.In 1971, he moved to the A Pro studio with Isao Takahata, then to Nippon Animation in 1973, where he was heavily involved in the World Masterpiece Theater TV animation series for the next five years. In 1978, he directed his first TV series, Mirai sh\u00f4nen Konan (1978) (Conan, The Boy in Future), then moved to T\u00f4ky\u00f4 Movie Shinsha in 1979 to direct his first movie, the classic O Castelo de Cagliostro (1979). In 1984, he released Nausica\u00e4 do Vale do Vento (1984), based on the manga (comic) of the same title he had started two years before. The success of the film led to the establishment of a new animation studio, Studio Ghibli (Sutajio Jiburi), at which Miyazaki has since directed, written, and produced many other films with Takahata and, more recently, Toshio Suzuki. All of these films enjoyed critical and box office successes. In particular, Miyazaki's Princesa Mononoke (1997) received the Japanese equivalent of the Academy Award for Best Film and was the highest-grossing (about USD$150 million) domestic film in Japan's history at the time of its release.In addition to animation, Miyazaki also draws manga. His major work was the Nausica\u00e4 manga, an epic tale he worked on intermittently from 1982 to 1984 while he was busy making animated films. Another manga, Hikoutei Jidai, was later evolved into his 1992 film Porco Rosso: O \u00daltimo Her\u00f3i Rom\u00e2ntico (1992).\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            A+8 <goodtanin@yahoo.com>\n          \n\n", "realName": null, "height": "164"},

Although regularly approached to act in films, he always turned down the opportunity until taking a role as an extra in Hong Sang-soo's O Dia em Que o Porco Caiu no Po\u00e7o (1996). In the following year, after portraying one of the homeless in Sun-Woo Jang's docu-drama Nappun yeonghwa (1997), he gained cult notoriety for his scene-stealing performance in Neung-han Song Songneunghan (1997) as a gangster training a group of young recruits, winning his first Best Actor award.Since that time he was cast in several supporting roles before his high-profile role as Suk-kyu Han's secret-agent partner in Je-kyu Kang's blockbuster thriller Shiri - Miss\u00e3o Terrorista (1999).

His mother, Mary Kathleen (McCabe), is a substitute school teacher originally from New Jersey. His father, James Donald McConaughey, was a Mississippi-born gas station owner who ran an oil pipe supply business. He is of Irish, Scottish, English, German, and Swedish descent. Matthew grew up in Longview, Texas, where he graduated from the local High School (1988). Showing little interest in his father's oil business, which his two brothers later joined, Matthew was longing for a change of scenery, and spent a year in Australia, washing dishes and shoveling chicken manure. Back to the States, he attended the University of Texas in Austin, originally wishing to be a lawyer. But, when he discovered an inspirational Og Mandino book \"The Greatest Salesman in the World\" before one of his final exams, he suddenly knew he had to change his major from law to film.He began his acting career in 1991, appearing in student films and commercials in Texas and directed short films as Chicano Chariots (1992). Once, in his hotel bar in Austin, he met the casting director and producer Don Phillips, who introduced him to director Richard Linklater for his next project. At first, Linklater thought Matthew was too handsome to play the role of a guy chasing high school girls in his coming-of-age drama Jovens, Loucos e Rebeldes (1993), but cast him after Matthew grew out his hair and mustache. His character was initially in three scenes but the role grew to more than 300 lines as Linklater encouraged him to do some improvisations. In 1995, he starred in O Massacre da Serra El\u00e9trica: O Retorno (1994), playing a mad bloodthirsty sadistic killer, opposite Ren\u00e9e Zellweger.Shortly thereafter, moving to L.A., Matthew became a sensation with his performances in two high-profile 1996 films Lone Star - A Estrela Solit\u00e1ria (1996), where he portrayed killing suspected sheriff and in the film adaptation of John Grisham's novel Tempo de Matar (1996), where he played an idealistic young lawyer opposite Sandra Bullock and Kevin Spacey. The actor was soon being hailed as one of the industry's hottest young leading man inspiring comparisons to actor Paul Newman. His following performances were Robert Zemeckis' Contato (1997) with Jodie Foster (the film was finished just before the death of the great astronomer and popularizer of space science Carl Sagan) and Steven Spielberg's Amistad (1997), a fact-based 1839 story about the rebellious African slaves. In 1998, he teamed again with Richard Linklater as one of the bank-robbing brothers in Newton Boys: Irm\u00e3os Fora-da-Lei (1998), set in Matthew's birthplace, Uvalde, Texas. During this time, he also wrote, directed and starred in the 20-minute short The Rebel (1998).In 1999, he starred in the comedy Ed TV (1999), about the rise of reality television, and in 2000, he headlined Jonathan Mostow's U-571: A Batalha do Atl\u00e2ntico (2000), portraying officer Lt. Tyler, in a WW II story of the daring mission of American submariners trying to capture the Enigma cipher machine.In the 2000s, he became known for starring in romantic comedies, such as O Casamento dos Meus Sonhos (2001), opposite Jennifer Lopez, and Como Perder um Homem em 10 Dias (2003), in which he co-starred with Kate Hudson.

After playing Connor Mead in Minhas Ador\u00e1veis Ex-Namoradas (2009), co-starring with Jennifer Garner, McConaughey took a two year hiatus to open different opportunities in his career. Since 2010, he has moved away from romantic comedies.That change came in 2011, in his first movie after that pause, when he portrayed criminal defense attorney Mickey Haller in O Poder e a Lei (2011), that operates mostly from the back seat of his Lincoln car.

Her first major role came in the short-lived television series Caia na Real (1999). She gained widespread recognition for her roles in O Di\u00e1rio da Princesa (2001) and its 2004 sequel as a young girl who discovers she is a member of royalty, opposite Julie Andrews and Heather Matarazzo.She also had a notable role in O Her\u00f3i da Fam\u00edlia (2002) opposite Charlie Hunnam and Jamie Bell, and a starring role in Uma Garota Encantada (2004). A former top-ranking soprano in New York, Hathaway was reportedly a front-runner for the role of \"Christine\" in the 2004 O Fantasma da \u00d3pera (2004). However, due to scheduling conflicts with O Di\u00e1rio da Princesa 2: Casamento Real (2004), she couldn't take the role, which was later given to newcomer Emmy Rossum.Hathaway soon started to move away from family-friendly films. Following O Di\u00e1rio da Princesa 2: Casamento Real (2004), she appeared topless in the films Garotas sem Rumo (2005) opposite Josh Peck and O Segredo de Brokeback Mountain (2005) opposite Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal. Her desire to break out of her \"Princess Diaries\" image parallels that of her one-time co-star, Julie Andrews, who went topless in the film S.O.B. Nos Bastidores de Hollywood (1981) in order to break away from the image she created from her 1960s musicals. In interviews, Hathaway said that doing family-friendly films didn't mean she was similar to their characters or mean she objected to appearing nude in other films.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            B -J - A\n          \n\n", "realName": "Anne Jacqueline Hathaway", "height": "173"},

		{"id": 137, "artistName": "Chazz Palminteri", "birthPlace": "New York City, New York, USA", "birthDate": "1952-05-15", "deathDate": null, "pictureurl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExNjU4NTUzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY3MDMzMTE@._V1_.jpg", "bio": "\n\n              Bronx-born and raised Chazz Palminteri was a natural choice to continue the Italianate torch in film. In the tradition set forth in the 1970s by such icons as director Martin Scorsese and actors Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, John Cazale and Joe Pesci, Palminteri has brought grit, muscle and an evocative realism to the sidewalks of his New York neighborhood, violent as they are and were.Chazz was born Calogero Lorenzo Palminteri in 1952 in the Bronx, New York, the son of Rose, a homemaker, and Lorenzo Palminteri, a bus driver. He grew up in a tough area of the Bronx, giving him the life lessons that would later prove very useful to his career. He graduated from Theodore Roosevelt High School and started out pursuing his craft in 1973 studying at the Actor's Studio. He appeared off-Broadway in the early 1980s while paying his dues as a bouncer and doorman in nightclubs, among other jobs.In 1986 he headed west and found that his ethnic qualifications was well-suited for getting tough-talker parts. Slick attorneys, unflinching hoods and hard-nosed cops were all part of his ethnic streetwise persona in such TV shows as O Homem da M\u00e1fia (1987), Matlock (1986) and Hill Street Blues (1981). In films he started off playing a 1930s-style gangster in Sylvester Stallone's Oscar: Minha Filha Quer Casar (1991). Although his roles were sharp, well-acted and with a distinct edge to them, there was nothing in them to show that he was capable of stronger leading parts.In 1988 he wrote for himself a play entitled \"A Bronx Tale,\" a powerful one-man stage commentary in which he depicted his bruising childhood in great detail, which included witnessing gangland slayings. Palminteri brought each and every character to life (18 in all) in this autobiographical piece -- his friends, enemies, even his own family. He showcased for years in both Los Angeles and New York, finally sparking the interest of his film idol, Robert De Niro. DeNiro, wanting to direct for the first time, saw the potential of this project and brought both it and the actor/writer to the screen. Palminteri played one of the flashier roles, Sonny, a gangster, in the movie version. An unknown film commodity at the time, Chazz had stubbornly refused to sell his stage property (the offers went into the seven figures) unless he was part of the package as both actor and screenwriter. DeNiro, who became his mentor, backed him up all the way, and the rest is history. Desafio no Bronx (1993) earned strong reviews.At age 41 Palminteri had become an \"overnight\" star. Other important projects quickly fell his way. He received a well-deserved Oscar nomination the following year for his portrayal of a Runyonesque hit man in Woody Allen's hilarious jazz-era comedy Tiros na Broadway (1994). He was on the right side of the law in both Tudo por um Sonho (1995), his first romantic lead, and then the classic crimer Os Suspeitos (1995). He played the ill-fated brute in Diabolique (1996) and wrote a second screenplay, Fiel, mas nem Tanto (1996), in which he again plays a hit man, terrorizing both Cher and Ryan O'Neal.Though Palminteri was invariably drawn into a rather tight-fitting, often violent typecast, it has been a secure and flashy one that continues to run strong into the millennium. Surprisingly, the one obvious show he missed out on was HBO's Fam\u00edlia Soprano (1999). True to form he has been more recently spotted in gritty urban settings playing a \"Hell's Kitchen\" cop in As Tr\u00eas Faces do Crime (2001) starring actor/producer Armand Assante; a pool hustler and mentor in Poolhall Junkies (2002); a mob boss in In the Fix (2005); a dirty cop in No Rastro da Bala (2006); the titular scam artist as Yonkers Joe (2008); a karaoke-loving Italian psychiatrist in Once More with Feeling (2009); and an abusive husband and father in Mighty Fine (2012). Occasionally he has lightened up a bit as in his recurring role as Shorty on Fam\u00edlia Moderna (2009)\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Gary Brumburgh / gr-home@pacbell.net\n          \n\n", "realName": "Calogero Lorenzo Palminteri", "height": "189"},

His father had Irish and English ancestry, and his mother was from a Jewish family (from Germany and Poland).Matthew initially took up acting at New York's upper-crust Walden School after being sidelined from his athletic pursuits (football and soccer) by a knee injury. His father got him his stage debut at age 17 in a workshop production of the play \"On Valentine's Day\". Matthew's career then accelerated with parts in two Neil Simon projects: the play \"Brighton Beach Memoirs\" (1982-83) and the feature film A Volta de Max Dugan (1983). Broderick reprised the role of Eugene in \"Biloxi Blues\" (1988), the second installment of the Simon trilogy, for both the Broadway production and the film adaptation (Metido em Encrencas (1988)). For the third and final installment of the trilogy, he was replaced by Jonathan Silverman. In 1983, the same year as A Volta de Max Dugan (1983), Broderick had his first big-screen success in the light comedy Jogos de Guerra (1983). Since then he has had his fair share of hits and misses, with some of his better films including Projeto Secreto: Macacos (1987) also starring Helen Hunt, whom he subsequently dated; A Lente do Amor (1997); and Inspetor Bugiganga (1999). Other films he has appeared in which may be known but not so much respected include Um Yuppie em Apuros (1992) with his Curtindo a Vida Adoidado (1986) co-star Jeffrey Jones; A Noite que Nunca Nos Encontramos (1993); O Fant\u00e1stico Mundo do Dr. Kellogg (1994); and O Pentelho (1996) with Jim Carrey, which got him an MTV \"Best Fight\" award nomination; and the MTV film Elei\u00e7\u00e3o (1999) with Reese Witherspoon. In 1985 he was involved in a controversial car crash while driving in Ireland with his then fianc\u00e9e Jennifer Grey. The crash killed a woman and her daughter. Broderick paid a small fine to the family of the victims. He broke his leg in the accident, which happened just as Curtindo a Vida Adoidado (1986), his biggest hit, was coming out in the US. The box office success (but critical flop) and special effects blockbuster Godzilla (1998) gave Broderick his first action role (should any \"Godzilla\" sequels be planned, he is under contract for two more). He has occasionally returned to the stage in New York, either in revivals of old musical warhorses such as \"How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying\" or in revivals of old \"show people\"plays, such as \"Night Must Fall\". In 1996 Broderick attempted to wear three hats as co-producer/director/actor in Infinity - Um Amor Sem Limites (1996), working very closely with his mother, who also wrote the screenplay. It was not a critical or commercial success, and he has not directed or produced since. Since May 1997 he has been married to actress Sarah Jessica Parker. He was previously engaged to both Helen Hunt and dated Lili Taylor. In 1999 he donned a trenchcoat for the children's film Inspetor Bugiganga (1999), alongside Rupert Everett as the evil villain Claw. In March 2001 Broderick returned to Broadway in the musical smash \"The Producers\" (based on the 1968 Mel Brooks film of the same name). He was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical, which he lost to his co-star, Nathan Lane.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            A.

He wound up being grounded when his family settled down in Hertfordshire. At the age of 13 he enrolled in Sherborne School, Dorset, where he could practice his favorite sport, horse-riding. Before becoming an actor, he had considered a veterinarian surgeon's career.He trained at the Bristol Old Vic School for two years, then joined Bristol Old Vic repertory company where he gained experience working in everything from Shakespeare to contemporary dramas. He moved to London in 1971 and had a number of jobs before landing the role of \"John the Baptist\" in the hit musical \"Godspell\". He went on to have a successful early career in the West End theatre and on TV, and debuted on-screen in Nijinsky, uma Hist\u00f3ria Real (1980). In the early 80s, he gained international attention with his starring role in the Granada Television serial adaptation of Evelyn Waugh's classic novel Mem\u00f3rias de Brideshead (1981), after which he was much in demand as a romantic leading man. He went on to a steady film career. In 1984, he debuted on Broadway opposite: Glenn Close in Tom Stoppard's \"The Real Thing\" and, in the mid-80s, he appeared in three lead roles with the Royal Shakespeare Company.Once described as 'the thinking woman's pin up', he has made his name in thought provoking films such as David Cronenberg's G\u00eameos - M\u00f3rbida Semelhan\u00e7a (1988), for which he won the New York Critics Best Actor Award.

Her mother, Emma (Harris), was a teacher and a nurse, and her father, Robert James Johnson, Jr., was a clergyman. Whoopi's recent ancestors were from Georgia, Florida, and Virginia. She worked in a funeral parlor and as a bricklayer while taking small parts on Broadway. She moved to California and worked with improv groups, including Spontaneous Combustion, and developed her skills as a stand-up comedienne. Goldberg came to prominence doing an HBO special and a one-woman show as Moms Mabley. She has been known in her prosperous career as a unique and socially conscious talent with articulately liberal views. Among her boyfriends were Ted Danson and Frank Langella. Goldberg was married three times and was once addicted to drugs.Goldberg had her first big film starring role in A Cor P\u00farpura (1985). She received much critical acclaim, and an Oscar nomination for her role and became a major star as a result. Subsequent efforts in the late 1980s were, at best, marginal hits. These movies mostly were off-beat to formulaic comedies like A Ladra (1987), O Telefone (1988) and Salve-me Quem Puder (1986). She made her mark as a household name and a mainstay in Hollywood for her Oscar-winning role in the box office smash Ghost: Do Outro Lado da Vida (1990). Whoopi Goldberg was at her most famous in the early 1990s, making regular appearances on Jornada nas Estrelas: A Nova Gera\u00e7\u00e3o (1987). She admitted to being a huge fan of the original Jornada nas Estrelas (1966) series and jumped at the opportunity to star in \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\".Goldberg received another smash hit role in Mudan\u00e7a de H\u00e1bito (1992). Her fish-out-of-water with some flash seemed to resonate with audiences and it was a box office smash. Whoopi starred in some highly publicized and moderately successful comedies of this time, including Feita por Encomenda (1993) and Segredos de uma Novela (1991). Goldberg followed up to her success with Mudan\u00e7a de H\u00e1bito 2: Mais Confus\u00f5es no Convento (1993), which was well-received but did not seem to match up to the first.As the late 1990s approached, Goldberg seemed to alternate between lead roles in straight comedies such as Eddie, Ningu\u00e9m Segura esta Mulher (1996) and O S\u00f3cio (1996), and took supporting parts in more independent minded movies, such as Nas Profundezas do Mar sem Fim (1999) and A Nova Paix\u00e3o de Stella (1998). Goldberg never forgot where she came from, hosting many tributes to other legendary entertainment figures. Her most recent movies include T\u00e1 Todo Mundo Louco! Uma Corrida por Milh\u00f5e$ (2001) and the quietly received Um Ritual do Barulho (2001). Goldberg contributes her voice to many cartoons, including Pagemaster, o Mestre da Fantasia (1994) and Capit\u00e3o Planeta (1990), as Gaia, the voice of the earth. Alternating between big-budget movies, independent movies, tributes, documentaries, and even television movies (including Meu Parceiro \u00e9 um Dinossauro (1995)).Whoopi is accredited as a truly unique and visible talent in Hollywood. Perhaps she will always be remembered as well for Comic Relief, playing an integral part in almost every benefit concert they had. Whoopi is also the center square in Hollywood Squares (1998), sometimes hosts the Academy Awards, and is an author, with the book \"Book.\"\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Scott msa0510@mail.ecu.edu\n          \n\n", "realName": "Caryn Elaine Johnson", "height": "165"},

Perhaps deserving better movies than she generally found herself in, she nevertheless was always an object of fascination and the one to watch...whatever the role. Hardly the shrinking violet type, Hollywood counted on her for her colorful personality, down-to-earth demeanor and scene-stealing capabilities.Beverly Heather D'Angelo was born on November 15, 1951 in Columbus, Ohio, the daughter of musicians Priscilla Ruth (Smith), a violinist, and Eugene Constantino \"Gene\" D'Angelo, a bass player who also managed a TV station. Her maternal grandfather, Howard Dwight Smith, was the architect who designed the Ohio (\"Horseshoe\") Stadium at Ohio State University. Her mother had English, Irish, Scottish, and German ancestry, and her father was of Italian descent. Beverly once attended an American school in Florence, Italy.Initially drawn to art, Beverly worked as a animator/cartoonist at Hanna-Barbera Productions before moving to Canada to pursue a rock singing career, To make ends meet she worked as a session vocalist and sang anyplace she could -- from coffeehouses to topless bars. At one point the teenager was invited to join up with rockabilly legend Ronnie Hawkins. Beverly's acting career started up when she left the Hawkins band and joined the Charlottetown Festival repertory company. She was touring Canada as Ophelia in \"Kronborg: 1582\", a rock musical version of Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" when the renowned Colleen Dewhurst caught a performance and saw promise in both Beverly and the show. Eventually musical director Gower Champion got into the mix and the show was completely revamped, becoming the rock musical \"Rockabye Hamlet\", which made its way to Broadway in 1976. While the show itself was short-lived, Beverly's Ophelia attracted fine notices and she soon found herself on the West coast with film and TV opportunities. After this point, she seldom returned to the stage but did star alongside Ed Harris in the 1995 off-Broadway production of Sam Shepard's \"Simpatico\", which earned her a Theatre World Award.A role in the TV miniseries Captains and the Kings (1976) led to bit parts in A Sentinela dos Malditos (1977) and in the Woody Allen classic Noivo Neur\u00f3tico, Noiva Nervosa (1977). A string of co-starring roles followed with First Love (1977), the Clint Eastwood starrer Doido para Brigar... Louco para Amar (1978) and the film adaptation of the hit counterculture musical Hair (1979). Best of all for Beverly was her powerhouse featured performance as the one-and-only Patsy Cline in the acclaimed biopic O Destino Mudou sua Vida (1980). Both she and Oscar winner Sissy Spacek (as fellow country singer Loretta Lynn) expertly supplied their own vocals.Playing everything from tough-as-nails prostitutes, party girls and barflies to rich, prim widows and depressed, alcoholic moms, most of Beverly's output was solid during this time. Playing happening kind of gals, she customarily rose above much of the standard comedic or dramatic material given. An interesting gallery of offbeat characters came her way in a number of hit-or-miss features: Paternidade (1981), Achado N\u00e3o \u00c9 Roubado (1984), Problemas em Dobro (1986), Cinderela \u00e0s Avessas (1987), Com Fantasmas N\u00e3o se Brinca (1988), No Alvo da Lei (1989), Daddy's Dyin'... Who's Got the Will? (1990), The Pope Must Die (1991), O C\u00e3o de Guarda (1992), Rapidinho no Gatilho (1994), Dois Pestinhas em Apuros (1994), Merchants of Venus (1998) and Sugar Town (1999). She also sang in a few of these films.Beverly attracted mainstream notice as Chevy Chase's beleaguered wife in the comedy spoof F\u00e9rias Frustradas (1983) and its three sequels. Stronger roles came with such films as the English/Irish production \u00c0 Procura do Destino (1991) and the Neo-Nazi film A Outra Hist\u00f3ria Americana (1998). She was also a favorite of director John Schlesinger who used her in Uma Estrada Muito Doida (1981) and Olho por Olho (1996), among others. In the spoof Pterodactyl Woman from Beverly Hills (1997), in which she served as associate producer, Beverly gamely starred as a chic Beverly Hills housewife who turns into a flying prehistoric reptile by night.On TV, Beverly scored well as matricide victim Kitty Menendez in Menendez: A Killing in Beverly Hills (1994) and earned an Emmy-nomination (and arguably gave the best performance) as Stella Kowalski opposite \"Hair\" co-star Treat Williams in the TV remake of A Streetcar Named Desire (1984). Other topnotch TV mini-movies included Sweet Temptation (1996) and A Marca de um Assassino (1993), in which she played Robert Blake's devout wife. On primetime she has been cast quite assertively in recurring parts -- lately she has been spotted on Lei & Ordem: Unidade de V\u00edtimas Especiais (1999) as a defense attorney, and on Entourage: Fama & Amizade (2004) as a talent agent.Beverly's off-camera romantic life has been just as interesting. Following her relationship with \"Hair\" director Milos Forman, she married Lorenzo Salviati, an economics student who also was an Italian duke. She left Hollywood and lived with him in Europe, but separated after two years and returned. A six-year relationship with Irish director Neil Jordan was followed by one with Oscar-winning production designer Anton Furst; this ended tragically when, just weeks after their breakup, he committed suicide. A former union with the volatile Al Pacino produced twins Olivia and Anton, who were born in 2001.These days, Beverly's career on camera has remained secondary to the raising of her children. Occasionally she has made use of her vocal talents performing at L.A. nightclubs and with a jazz band that included brother Jeff. From time to time she still lights up the screen as a brash professional or somebody's colorful mom; whatever time she has on screen, whether major or minor, it is always welcomed and never, ever less than...interesting.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Gary Brumburgh / gr-home@pacbell.net\n          \n\n", "realName": "Beverly Heather D'Angelo", "height": "157"},

Kaye is a six time Grammy nominated music video director. His feature film debut was American History X (1998), a drama about racism starring Edward Norton and Edward Furlong.

She is the youngest of five children. Her parents are Barbara Anne (Barry) and Clifford Elwin \"Cliff\" Thompson. Since all her siblings were much older than she, Lea says it seemed like she had more than two parents. The family lived in the Starlight Motel, all the kids sharing a room. Things began to look up for the family when Lea's father got a job in Minneapolis, where the family moved.Lea's parents divorced when she was six, and her mother decided to maintain the family. This wasn't the easiest job, considering her mother was alcohol-addicted at the time. When she found the strength to quit drinking, she took a job playing the piano and singing in a bar to support Lea and her siblings. When Lea was seven, her mother remarried. Ever since Lea was little, she loved to dance -- ballet to be exact. She would practice three to four hours every day. Her first role was as a mouse in \"The Nutcracker\". After Lea turned fourteen, she had performed in more than 45 ballets on stages, such as The Minnesota Dance Theatre, The Pennsylvania Ballet Company, and The Ballet Repertory. She won scholarships to The American Ballet Theatre and The San Francisco Ballet. At age nineteen, she auditioned for Mikhail Baryshnikov, who later told her that she was \"a beautiful dancer... but too stocky\". Lea knew her dreams had been crushed. At that point, she decided to turn to acting. She began working as a waitress, also making 22 Burger King commercials and a few Twix commercials. She was perfect for these parts simply because she was the average girl-down-the-street, from the Midwest. Everyone who knows her can't believe she was and still is so completely different...trying to be independent and fight against the system. In 1982, Lea made some type of a computer game or interactive movie known as \"Murder, Anyone\".Her first role was in the movie, Tubar\u00e3o 3 (1983), as a water ski bunny, although she couldn't swim or ski, which she still can't! There, she met Dennis Quaid, who became her fianc\u00e9e and acting coach. Her next role was in A Chance (1983), where she acted opposite Tom Cruise. Director Michael Chapman was so disappointed with her performance, that he almost fired her. Between 1983 and 1984, Lea appeared in other \"teen\" movies, such as Amanhecer Violento (1984), Vida Maluca (1984), and Going Undercover (aka Yellow Pages (1985)), and believes it was lucky that, in these movies, they were able to use anyone who could walk and talk! Lea's biggest known accomplishment, and her big break, came from the first De Volta para o Futuro (1985). It was the biggest hit of 1985, and Lea was suddenly the most wanted actress. She could have her pick of any role she wanted to take on. She chose Howard, o Super-Her\u00f3i (1986). Although it was a George Lucas production, the critics turned the movie, and Lea, down. Afterwards, director Howard Deutch offered Lea a part in his movie, Algu\u00e9m Muito Especial (1987), but she refused. After he urged her to do it, she reconsidered. She won the Young Artist Award for best young actress. During filming, Howard and Lea fell in love, and she called it off with Dennis. She then went on to film Mensageiro da Esperan\u00e7a (1988), which was her first movie as a woman, rather than a youngster. Lea went on to film De Volta para o Futuro II (1989) and an episode of Contos da Cripta (1989). She then married Howard Deutch. She continued filming De Volta para o Futuro III (1990), Montana (1990), and Hospital de Her\u00f3is (1992). Lea then took a break to stay home with her first born, Madelyn Deutch.She jumped back into acting in Dennis, o Pimentinha (1993), where she says she just played herself. Then it was on to A Fam\u00edlia Buscap\u00e9 (1993), Stolen Babies (1993), Os Batutinhas (1994), and A Substituta (1994). In 1994, she had her second child, Zoey Deutch. Lea then went into filming The Unspoken Truth (1995). It was then that she was first given the script of a new NBC sitcom, Tudo Por Um Gato (1995). It was probably the best decision Lea ever made. She won a People's Choice Award for best actress in a new sitcom. Unfortunately, with all of NBC's problems, Tudo Por Um Gato (1995) kept being moved to a worse and worse time slot, giving it horrible ratings. The show ended after only four seasons. Bad ideas from the creators (Julia, etc.) didn't help, either.Lea quickly went onto The Right to Remain Silent (1996), The Unknown Cyclist (1998), and A Will of Their Own (1998). She also guest-starred in the Friends (1994) episode, Friends: The One with the Baby on the Bus (1995), as \"Caroline Duffy\", and on The Larry Sanders Show (1992). Lea also did some stage work, including starring as \"Sally Bowles\" in \"Cabaret\". The show toured and also appeared on Broadway. She then did \"The Vagina Monologues\" in L.A. She had a stint in a dramatic role as a Chief Deputy Assistant District Attorney, \"Camille Paris\", on For the People (2002). Thompson has starred in more than 30 films, 25 television movies, 4 television series, more than 20 ballets, and starred on Broadway in \"Cabaret\". Lea can currently be seen on ABC Family's Peabody Award winning hit show \"Switched at Birth,\" where she acts and directs. Lea's movie credits include: \"All the Right Moves,\" \"Red Dawn,\" \"Some Kind of Wonderful,\" \"The Beverly Hillbillies,\" \"Howard The Duck\"(star and vocals), Clint Eastwood's \"J. Edgar;\" the 2014 Sundance favorite \"Ping Pong Summer;\" and soon to be released \"Left Behind\" starring Nicolas Cage.Lea lives in Los Angeles with her husband of twenty-five years, film/television director Howard Deutch, and their two talented daughters, Madelyn and Zoey, along with many dogs, fish, horses, chickens, a cat, tortoise, and parrot. She supports and often performs for breast cancer, mental health, and Alzheimer's charities. Lea is currently in pre-production on \"The Year of Spectacular Men\", a film written by her daughter Madelyn Deutch, and is writing her first book of essays.

		{"id": 158, "artistName": "Crispin Glover", "birthPlace": "New York City, New York, USA", "birthDate": "1964-04-20", "deathDate": null, "pictureurl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjNjMzg2YWEtOTY4Ny00MDJiLTg1NWYtOGI5NmU2ZTE5OTI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_.jpg", "bio": "\n\n              While he's never been a typical leading man, Crispin Glover has distinguished himself as one of the most intriguing personalities in the movie business. His unusual characters and personal projects have inspired a cult-like following that has dubbed him both madman and genius.The son of actress and dancer Betty Glover and actor Bruce Glover, Crispin Hellion Glover was born in New York City and raised in Southern California. He was named after the Saint Crispin's Day speech in Shakespeare's Henry V. His middle name, Hellion, was also used by his father. Crispin picked up his father's trade while still in elementary school--by age thirteen, he already had an agent scouting out parts. A lead in a stage production of \"The Sound of Music\" (starring Florence Henderson) led to guest spots on the TV shows Happy Days (1974), Hill Street Blues (1981) and Caras e Caretas (1982), which in turn led to roles in made-for-TV movies. The adolescent Glover felt \"confined\" by TV work, however, so he opted to stick to movie parts. He made his big-screen debut in the teen hi-jinx movie in Minha Professora de Franc\u00eas (1983), then followed up with a supporting role in Sexta-Feira 13, Parte 4: O Cap\u00edtulo Final (1984).Glover's most defining Hollywood moment happened the next year, when he appeared as George McFly (Michael J. Fox's father) in the instant classic De Volta para o Futuro (1985). The underdog character struck a chord with moviegoers. Oddly enough, the actor delivered one of his favorite performances around the same time--playing a small-town kid obsessed with Olivia Newton-John in the indie The Orkly Kid (1985)--but the smaller film was completely overshadowed by his commercial success. Glover did, however, receive critical praise for his next indie role, a starring turn as a high-strung murder witness in Juventude Assassina (1986). Glover and the producers did not come to a financial agreement for him to reprise the role of George McFly in De Volta para o Futuro II (1989). The producers brought the character back to life by splicing together archived footage and new scenes (using an actor in prosthetic makeup). Glover, who hadn't given permission for his likeness to be used, sued the film's producer, Steven Spielberg, and won. The case prompted the Screen Actors Guild to devise new regulations about the use of actors' images.In 1990 Glover teamed up with fellow eccentric David Lynch to play the maniacal Cousin Dell in Cora\u00e7\u00e3o Selvagem (1990). He filled the next decade with similarly quirky, peripheral roles, including a turn as Andy Warhol in The Doors (1991) and a cameo as a train fireman in Jim Jarmusch's Homem Morto (1995). His small but memorable appearances in films like Gilbert Grape: Aprendiz de Sonhador (1993), At\u00e9 as Vaqueiras Ficam Tristes (1993) and O Povo Contra Larry Flint (1996) often outshone the main action.When he's not stealing scenes from Hollywood hotshots, Glover pours his considerable energy into other creative endeavors. He wrote his first book, \"Billow Rock\", before age 18, and since then he's gone on to create a library of peculiar titles (several of which have been published through his family's Volcanic Eruptions press). Among his most famous volumes are \"Rat Catching\" and \"Oak-Mot\", both Victorian-era stories updated with macabre illustrations and cut-up text. In 1989 he released an album of spoken word readings and cover tunes (including a rendition of \"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\") entitled \"The Big Problem [does not equal] the Solution. The Solution = Let it be.\"In 1995 Glover began shooting his directorial debut, What Is It? (2005), a surreal film populated entirely by actors with Down's Syndrome. He tours with the film and its sequel It Is Fine! Everything Is Fine. (2007) and his show, \"Crispin Hellion Glover's Big Slide Show,\" which is a one hour dramatic narration of eight different profusely illustrated books. The artist in Glover has been said to be inspired by \"the aesthetic of discomfort,\" a theme which seems to have been carried over into an artistic public performance on David Letterman's NBC show in 1987, Glover emerged wearing a wig and platform shoes, then delivered a swift kick toward Letterman's head that prompted the producers to cut to a commercial. Late 2000 saw him hitting the multiplex with roles in A Enfermeira Betty (2000) and As Panteras (2000), and the titular Willard (2003). He re-teamed with Back to the Future director Robert Zemeckis as Grendel in Beowulf (2007) and has worked with Johnny Depp for the third time in Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland (2010). Other Glover projects loom on the not-too-distant horizon.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            IMDb Editors\n          \n\n", "realName": "Crispin Hellion Glover", "height": "178"},

Of English, Irish and Scottish descent, Frank attended St. Gregory the Great School and then was actually training to follow in his father's footsteps as a butcher himself when his side interest in acting eventually won out. He became a member of the Farnworth Little Theatre and met his future wife, Doreen Shepherd, a fellow member at the same time. They married in 1954, had three children (two sons, one daughter) and were married for over 50 years until her death in 2005.Finlay began his professional career on the repertory stage with roles in The Guilford Theatre Company's 1957 productions of \"Jessica\" and \"The Telescope\". Graduating from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), he built up a strong and sturdy theatrical reputation at the Royal Court Theatre between 1958 and 1960 where he was seen to good advantage in such plays as \"Chicken Soup and Barley\", \"Sugar in the Morning\", \"Sergeant Musgrave's Dance\", \"Roots\", \"I'm Talking About Jerusalem\", \"The Happy Haven\" and \"Platonov\". Making his Broadway debut in \"The Epitaph of George Dillon\" in 1959, he also sparked a noteworthy professional association with Laurence Olivier at the National Theatre, the highlight being his intense but subtle portrayal of \"Iago\" to Olivier's \"Othello\" in 1964.Marking his film debut in a bit role in A Solid\u00e3o do Corredor de Fundo (1962), Finlay sandwiched in a steady stream of British film parts (including Private Potter (1962), Consult\u00f3rio Indiscreto (1963), Agente Secreto Desafia Moscou (1964), The Comedy Man (1964), N\u00e9voas do Terror (1965) (as \"Jack the Ripper\" Inspector Lestrade), O Golpe do S\u00e9culo (1967), A Picada Mortal (1966) and Os 26 do Expresso Postal (1967)) in between theatre assignments. His greatest film opportunity occurred when he was given the right by Olivier to recreate his Iago role opposite the legendary actor in the masterful film adaptation of Othello (1965). Finlay, Maggie Smith (as \"Desdemona\") and Joyce Redman (as \"Emilia\") all received Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for their illustrious \"supporting\" work of Olivier (who was also Oscar nominated). Frank went on to nab a \"Most Promising Newcomer\" nomination from the BAFTA committee as well. To date, this has been the actor's only Oscar recognition.Frank's film output, aside from his dashing role as \"Porthos\" for director Richard Lester in the ripe Dumas adaptation of Os Tr\u00eas Mosqueteiros (1973) (and its sequels A Vingan\u00e7a de Milady (1974) and A Volta dos Mosqueteiros (1989)), has been at an international level. Films include As Sand\u00e1lias do Pescador (1968), Cromwell, O Homem de Ferro (1970), Ver-te-ei no Inferno (1970), Shaft na \u00c1frica (1973), Selvagens C\u00e3es de Guerra (1978), Assassinato Por Decreto (1979) (again as \"Inspector Lestrade\"), O Retorno do Soldado (1982), A Chave (1983) [The Key], For\u00e7a Sinistra (1985), Mountain of Diamonds (1991), So This Is Romance? (1997), Silent Cry (2002) and, most notably, the Oscar-winning WWII picture O Pianista (2002), directed by Roman Polanski, in which he portrayed the patriarch of a displaced Jewish family that included \"Best Actor\" son Adrien Brody.Classical television notice came in middle age with Frank's strong performances as \"Jean Valjean\" in the British TV mini-series \"Les Miserables\" (1967) and the title role in Casanova (1971). He also went on to win stellar praise and a BAFTA award for his chilling portrayal of \"Adolf Hitler\" in ITV Saturday Night Theatre: The Death of Adolf Hitler (1973). Finlay and Susan Penhaligon courted controversy in the drama series Bouquet of Barbed Wire (1976) and were reunited in further controversy the following year with its follow-up Another Bouquet (1977). More plentiful and prestigious BBC-TV work came with his roles as Shakespeare's \"Brutus\" and \"Shylock\", not to mention his award-winning performances as \"Voltaire\" and \"Sancho Panza\".In Dr\u00e1cula (1977), Finlay played \"Van Helsing\" to nemesis Louis Jourdan's velvety-voiced vampire; in Um Conto de Natal (1984), he was the dour, shackled \"Jacob Marley\", who pays a ghostly visit to George C. Scott's crusty \"Ebenezer Scrooge\"; and in Eroica (2003), he portrayed composer \"Franz Josef Haydn\" alongside Ian Hart's \"Beethoven\".

Having made films in Poland, Britain, France and the USA, he is considered one of the few truly international filmmakers. Roman Polanski was born in Paris in 1933.His parents returned to Poland from France in 1936, three years before World War II began. On Germany's invasion in 1939, as a family of mostly Jewish heritage, they were all sent to the Krakow ghetto. His parents were then captured and sent to two different concentration camps: His father to Mauthausen-Gusen in Austria, where he survived the war, and his mother to Auschwitz where she was murdered. Roman witnessed his father's capture and then, at only 7, managed to escape the ghetto and survive the war, at first wandering through the Polish countryside and pretending to be a Roman-Catholic kid visiting his relatives. Although this saved his life, he was severely mistreated suffering nearly fatal beating which left him with a fractured skull.Local people usually ignored the cinemas where German films were shown, but Polanski seemed little concerned by the propaganda and often went to the movies. As the war progressed, Poland became increasingly war-torn and he lived his life as a tramp, hiding in barns and forests, eating whatever he could steal or find. Still under 12 years old, he encountered some Nazi soldiers who forced him to hold targets while they shot at them. At the war's end in 1945, he reunited with his father who sent him to a technical school, but young Polanski seemed to have already chosen another career. In the 1950s, he took up acting, appearing in Andrzej Wajda's Gera\u00e7\u00e3o (1955) before studying at the Lodz Film School. His early shorts such as Dwaj ludzie z szafa (1958), Le gros et le maigre (1961) and Ssaki (1962), showed his taste for black humor and interest in bizarre human relationships. His feature debut, A Faca na \u00c1gua (1962), was one of the first Polish post-war films not associated with the war theme. It was also the first movie from Poland to get an Oscar nomination for best foreign film. Though already a major Polish filmmaker, Polanski chose to leave the country and headed to France. While down-and-out in Paris, he befriended young scriptwriter, G\u00e9rard Brach, who eventually became his long-time collaborator. The next two films, Repulsa ao Sexo (1965) and Armadilha do Destino (1966), made in England and co-written by Brach, won respectively Silver and then Golden Bear awards at the Berlin International Film Festival. In 1968, Polanski went to Hollywood, where he made the psychological thriller, O Beb\u00ea de Rosemary (1968). However, after the brutal murder of his wife, Sharon Tate, by the Manson Family in 1969, the director decided to return to Europe. In 1974, he again made a US release - it was Chinatown (1974).It seemed the beginning of a promising Hollywood career, but after his conviction for the sodomy of a 13-year old girl, Polanski fled from he USA to avoid prison. After Tess - Uma Li\u00e7\u00e3o de Vida (1979), which was awarded several Oscars and Cesars, his works in 1980s and 1990s became intermittent and rarely approached the caliber of his earlier films. It wasn't until O Pianista (2002) that Polanski came back to full form. For that movie, he won nearly all the most important film awards, including the Oscar for Best Director, Cannes Film Festival's Palme d'Or, the BAFTA and Cesar Award.He still likes to act in the films of other directors, sometimes with interesting results, as in Uma Simples Formalidade (1994).\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Yuri German (blsidt1 AT imf.org)\n          \n\n", "realName": "Rajmund Roman Liebling", "height": "165"},
		{"id": 164, "artistName": "Arnold Schwarzenegger", "birthPlace": "Thal, Styria, Austria", "birthDate": "1947-07-30", "deathDate": null, "pictureurl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI3MDc4NzUyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTQyMTc5MQ@@._V1_.jpg", "bio": "\n\n              With an almost unpronounceable surname and a thick Austrian accent, who would have ever believed that a brash, quick talking bodybuilder from a small European village would become one of Hollywood's biggest stars, marry into the prestigious Kennedy family, amass a fortune via shrewd investments and one day be the Governor of California!?The amazing story of megastar Arnold Schwarzenegger is a true \"rags to riches\" tale of a penniless immigrant making it in the land of opportunity, the United States of America. Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger was born July 30, 1947, in the town of Thal, Styria, Austria, to Aurelia Schwarzenegger (born Jadrny) and Gustav Schwarzenegger, the local police chief. From a young age, he took a keen interest in physical fitness and bodybuilding, going on to compete in several minor contests in Europe. However, it was when he emigrated to the United States in 1968 at the tender age of 21 that his star began to rise.Up until the early 1970s, bodybuilding had been viewed as a rather oddball sport, or even a mis-understood \"freak show\" by the general public, however two entrepreneurial Canadian brothers Ben Weider and Joe Weider set about broadening the appeal of \"pumping iron\" and getting the sport respect, and what better poster boy could they have to lead the charge, then the incredible \"Austrian Oak\", Arnold Schwarzenegger. Over roughly the next decade, beginning in 1970, Schwarzenegger dominated the sport of competitive bodybuilding winning five Mr. Universe titles and seven Mr. Olympia titles and, with it, he made himself a major sports icon, he generated a new international audience for bodybuilding, gym memberships worldwide swelled by the tens of thousands and the Weider sports business empire flourished beyond belief and reached out to all corners of the globe. However, Schwarzenegger's horizons were bigger than just the landscape of bodybuilding and he debuted on screen as \"Arnold Strong\" in the low budget Hercules in New York (1970), then director Bob Rafelson cast Arnold in O Guarda-Costas (1976) alongside Jeff Bridges and Sally Field, for which Arnold won a Golden Globe Award for \"Best Acting Debut in a Motion Picture\". The mesmerizing O Homem dos M\u00fasculos de A\u00e7o (1977) covering the 1975 Mr Olympia contest in South Africa has since gone on to become one of the key sports documentaries of the 20th century, plus Arnold landed other acting roles in the comedy Cactus Jack, o Vil\u00e3o (1979) opposite Kirk Douglas, and he portrayed Mickey Hargitay in the well- received TV movie Jayne Mansfield: S\u00edmbolo Sexual (1980).What Arnold really needed was a super hero / warrior style role in a lavish production that utilized his chiseled physique, and gave him room to show off his growing acting talents and quirky humor. Conan, o B\u00e1rbaro (1982) was just that role. Inspired by the Robert E. Howard short stories of the \"Hyborean Age\" and directed by gung ho director John Milius, and with a largely unknown cast, save Max von Sydow and James Earl Jones, \"Conan\" was a smash hit worldwide and an inferior, although still enjoyable sequel titled Conan, o Destruidor (1984) quickly followed. If \"Conan\" was the kick start to Arnold's movie career, then his next role was to put the pedal to the floor and accelerate his star status into overdrive. Director James Cameron had until that time only previously directed one earlier feature film titled Piranhas 2: Assassinas Voadoras (1981), which stank of rotten fish from start to finish. However, Cameron had penned a fast paced, science fiction themed film script that called for an actor to play an unstoppable, ruthless predator - O Exterminador do Futuro (1984). Made on a relatively modest budget, the high voltage action / science fiction thriller O Exterminador do Futuro (1984) was incredibly successful worldwide, and began one of the most profitable film franchises in history. The dead pan phrase \"I'll be back\" quickly became part of popular culture across the globe. Schwarzenegger was in vogue with action movie fans, and the next few years were to see Arnold reap box office gold in roles portraying tough, no-nonsense individuals who used their fists, guns and witty one-liners to get the job done. The testosterone laden Comando para Matar (1985), Jogo Bruto (1986), O Predador (1987), O Sobrevivente (1987) and Inferno Vermelho (1988) were all box office hits and Arnold could seemingly could no wrong when it came to picking winning scripts. The tongue-in-cheek comedy Irm\u00e3os G\u00eameos (1988) with co-star Danny DeVito was a smash and won Arnold new fans who saw a more comedic side to the muscle- bound actor once described by Australian author / TV host Clive James as \"a condom stuffed with walnuts\". The spectacular O Vingador do Futuro (1990) and \"feel good\" Um Tira no Jardim de Inf\u00e2ncia (1990) were both solid box office performers for Arnold, plus he was about to return to familiar territory with director James Cameron in O Exterminador do Futuro 2: O Julgamento Final (1991). The second time around for the futuristic robot, the production budget had grown from the initial film's $6.5 million to an alleged $100 million for the sequel, and it clearly showed as the stunning sequel bristled with amazing special effects, bone-crunching chases & stunt sequences, plus state of the art computer-generated imagery. O Exterminador do Futuro 2: O Julgamento Final (1991) was arguably the zenith of Arnold's film career to date and he was voted \"International Star of the Decade\" by the National Association of Theatre Owners.Remarkably, his next film O \u00daltimo Grande Her\u00f3i (1993) brought Arnold back to Earth with a hard thud as the self-satirizing, but confusing plot line of a young boy entering into a mythical Hollywood action film confused movie fans even more and they stayed away in droves making the film an initial financial disaster. Arnold turned back to good friend, director James Cameron and the chemistry was definitely still there as the \"James Bond\" style spy thriller True Lies (1994) co-starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Tom Arnold was the surprise hit of 1994! Following the broad audience appeal of True Lies (1994), Schwarzenegger decided to lean towards more family-themed entertainment with J\u00fanior (1994) and Um Her\u00f3i de Brinquedo (1996), but he still found time to satisfy his hard-core fan base with Queima de Arquivo (1996), as the chilling \"Mr. Freeze\" in Batman & Robin (1997) and battling dark forces in the supernatural action of Fim dos Dias (1999). The science fiction / conspiracy tale O 6\u00ba Dia (2000) played to only mediocre fan interest, and Efeito Colateral (2002) had its theatrical release held over for nearly a year after the tragic events of Sept 11th 2001, but it still only received a lukewarm reception.It was time again to resurrect Arnold's most successful franchise and, in 2003, Schwarzenegger pulled on the biker leathers for the third time for O Exterminador do Futuro 3: A Rebeli\u00e3o das M\u00e1quinas (2003). Unfortunately, directorial duties passed from James Cameron to Jonathan Mostow and the deletion of the character of \"Sarah Connor\" aka Linda Hamilton and a change in the actor playing \"John Connor\" - Nick Stahl took over from Edward Furlong - making the third entry in the \"Terminator\" series the weakest to date.Schwarzenegger married TV journalist Maria Shriver in April, 1986 and the couple have four children.In October of 2003 Schwarzenegger, running as a Republican, was elected Governor of California in a special recall election of then governor Gray Davis. The \"Governator,\" as Schwarzenegger came to be called, held the office until 2011. Upon leaving the Governor's mansion it was revealed that he had fathered a child with the family's live-in maid and Shriver filed for divorce.Schwarzenegger contributed cameo roles to Bem-Vindo \u00e0 Selva (2003), Volta ao Mundo em 80 Dias: Uma Aposta Muito Louca (2004) and O Garoto & Eu (2005). Recently, he starred in Os Mercen\u00e1rios 2 (2012), O \u00daltimo Desafio (2013), Rota de Fuga (2013), Os Mercen\u00e1rios 3 (2014), and O Exterminador do Futuro: G\u00eanesis (2015).\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            David Montgomery < djmont@aol.com> and davesusanv@gmail.com\n          \n\n", "realName": "Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger", "height": "188"},

He is most recognized as an icon of the silent film era, often associated with his popular character, the Little Tramp; the man with the toothbrush mustache, bowler hat, bamboo cane, and a funny walk.Charles Spencer Chaplin was born in Walworth, London, England on April 16, 1889, to Hannah Harriet Pedlingham (Hill) and Charles Chaplin, both music hall performers, who were married on June 22, 1885. After Charles Sr. separated from Hannah to perform in New York City, Hannah then tried to resurrect her stage career. Unfortunately, her singing voice had a tendency to break at unexpected moments. When this happened, the stage manager spotted young Charlie standing in the wings and led him on stage, where five-year-old Charlie began to sing a popular tune. Charlie and his half-brother, Syd Chaplin spent their lives in and out of charity homes and workhouses between their mother's bouts of insanity. Hannah was committed to Cane Hill Asylum in May 1903 and lived there until 1921, when Chaplin moved her to California.Chaplin began his official acting career at the age of eight, touring with the Eight Lancashire Lads. At age 18, he began touring with Fred Karno's vaudeville troupe, joining them on the troupe's 1910 United States tour. He traveled west to California in December 1913 and signed on with Keystone Studios' popular comedy director Mack Sennett, who had seen Chaplin perform on stage in New York. Charlie soon wrote his brother Syd, asking him to become his manager. While at Keystone, Chaplin appeared in and directed 35 films, starring as the Little Tramp in nearly all.In November 1914, he left Keystone and signed on at Essanay, where he made 15 films. In 1916, he signed on at Mutual and made 12 films. In June 1917, Chaplin signed up with First National Studios, after which he built Chaplin Studios. In 1919, he and Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford and D.W. Griffith formed United Artists (UA).Chaplin's life and career was full of scandal and controversy. His first big scandal was during World War I, during which time his loyalty to England, his home country, was questioned. He had never applied for American citizenship, but claimed that he was a \"paying visitor\" to the United States. Many British citizens called Chaplin a coward and a slacker. This and his other career eccentricities sparked suspicion with FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover and the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), who believed that he was injecting Communist propaganda into his films. Chaplin's later film O Grande Ditador (1940), which was his first \"talkie\", also created a stir. In the film, Chaplin plays a humorous caricature of Adolf Hitler. Some thought the film was poorly done and in bad taste. However, the film grossed over $5 million and earned five Academy Award Nominations.Another scandal occurred when Chaplin briefly dated 22-year-old Joan Barry. However, Chaplin's relationship with Barry came to an end in 1942, after a series of harassing actions from her. In May 1943, Barry returned to inform Chaplin that she was pregnant and filed a paternity suit, claiming that the unborn child was his. During the 1944 trial, blood tests proved that Chaplin was not the father, but at the time, blood tests were inadmissible evidence and he was ordered to pay $75 a week until the child turned 21.Chaplin was also scrutinized for his support in aiding the Russian struggle against the invading Nazis during World War II, and the United States government questioned his moral and political views, suspecting him of having Communist ties. For this reason, HUAC subpoenaed him in 1947. However, HUAC finally decided that it was no longer necessary for him to appear for testimony. Conversely, when Chaplin and his family traveled to London for the premier of Luzes da Ribalta (1952), he was denied re-entry to the United States. In reality, the government had almost no evidence to prove that he was a threat to national security. Instead, he and his wife decided to settle in Switzerland.Chaplin was married four times and had a total of 11 children. In 1918, he married Mildred Harris and they had a son together, Norman Spencer Chaplin, who only lived three days. Chaplin and Mildred were divorced in 1920. He married Lita Grey in 1924, who had two sons, Charles Chaplin Jr. and Sydney Chaplin. They were divorced in 1927. In 1936, Chaplin married Paulette Goddard and his final marriage was to Oona O'Neill (Oona Chaplin), daughter of playwright Eugene O'Neill in 1943. Oona gave birth to eight children: Geraldine Chaplin, Michael Chaplin, Josephine Chaplin, Victoria Chaplin, Eugene Chaplin, Jane Chaplin, Annette-Emilie Chaplin and Christopher Chaplin.In contrast to many of his boisterous characters, Chaplin was a quiet man who kept to himself a great deal. He also had an \"un-millionaire\" way of living. Even after he had accumulated millions, he continued to live in shabby accommodations. In 1921, Chaplin was decorated by the French government for his outstanding work as a filmmaker, and was elevated to the rank of Officer of the Legion of Honor in 1952. In 1972, he was honored with an Academy Award for his \"incalculable effect in making motion pictures the art form of the century.\" He was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1975 New Years Honours List. No formal reason for the honour was listed. The citation simply reads \"Charles Spencer Chaplin, Film Actor and Producer\".Chaplin's other works included musical scores he composed for many of his films. He also authored two autobiographical books, \"My Autobiography\" (1964) and its companion volume, \"My Life in Pictures\" (1974).Chaplin died at age 88 of natural causes on December 25, 1977 at his home in Vevey, Switzerland. His funeral was a small and private Anglican ceremony according to his wishes. In 1978, Chaplin's corpse was stolen from its grave and was not recovered for three months; he was re-buried in a vault surrounded by cement.Six of Chaplin's films have been selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the United States Library of Congress: The Immigrant (1917), The Kid (1921), The Gold Rush (1925), City Lights (1931), Modern Times (1936) and The Great Dictator (1940).Charlie Chaplin was considered one of the greatest filmmakers in the history of American cinema, whose movies were and still are popular throughout the world, and have even gained notoriety as time progresses. His films show, through the Little Tramp's positive outlook on life in a world full of chaos, that the human spirit has and always will remain the same.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Ed Stephan <stephan@cc.wwu.edu>\n          \n\n", "realName": "Charles Spencer Chaplin", "height": "163"},

After her divorce she went to Hollywood in 1931, where she appeared in small roles in pictures for a number of studios. A stunning natural beauty, Paulette could mesmerize any man she met, a fact she was well aware of. One of her bigger roles in that period was as a blond \"Goldwyn Girl\" in the Eddie Cantor film Meu Boi Morreu (1932). In 1932 she met Charles Chaplin, and they soon became an item around town. He cast her in Tempos Modernos (1936), which was a big hit, but her movie career was not going anywhere because of her relationship with Chaplin. They were secretly married in 1936, but the marriage failed and they were separated by 1940. It was her role as Miriam Aarons in As Mulheres (1939), however, that got her a contract with Paramount. Paulette was one of the many actresses tested for the part of Scarlett O'Hara in ...E o Vento Levou (1939), but she lost the part to Vivien Leigh and instead appeared with Bob Hope in O Gato e o Can\u00e1rio (1939), a good film but hardly in the same league as GWTW. The 1940s were Paulette's busiest period. She worked with Chaplin in O Grande Ditador (1940), Cecil B. DeMille in Vendaval de Paix\u00f5es (1942) and Burgess Meredith in Segredos de Alcova (1946). She was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in A Legi\u00e3o Branca (1943). Her star faded in the late 1940s, however, and she was dropped by Paramount in 1949. After a couple of \"B\" movies, she left films and went to live in Europe as a wealthy expatriate; she married German novelist Erich Maria Remarque in the late 1950s. She was coaxed back to the screen once more, although it was the small screen, for the television movie The Snoop Sisters: The Female Instinct (1972).\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Tony Fontana <tony.fontana@spacebbs.com>\n          \n\n", "realName": "Pauline Marion Goddard Levy", "height": "160"},

Living in apartments, Janet was a bright child who skipped several grades and finished high school when she was 15. A lonely child, she would spend much of her time at movie theaters. She was a student, studying music and psychology, at the University of the Pacific until she was \"discovered\" while visiting her parents in Northern California. Her father was working the desk at a ski resort where her mother worked as a maid. Retired MGM actress Norma Shearer saw a picture of Janet on the front desk and asked if she could borrow it. This led to a screen test at MGM and a starring role in Reconcilia\u00e7\u00e3o (1947). MGM was looking for a young naive country girl and Janet filled the bill perfectly. She would play the young ing\u00e9nue in a number of films and work with such stars as Errol Flynn, Gary Cooper, James Stewart, Orson Welles and Judy Garland. She appeared in a number of successful films, including Quatro Destinos (1949), Anjos e Piratas (1951), Scaramouche (1952), Houdini, o Homem Miraculoso (1953) and O Escudo Negro de Falworth (1954), among others. Janet would appear in a variety of films, from comedies to westerns to musicals to dramas. Of her more than 50 movies, she would be remembered for the 45 minutes that she was on the screen in the small-budget thriller Psicose (1960). Directed by Alfred Hitchcock, this 1960 classic would include the shower scene that would become a film landmark. Even though her character is killed off early in the picture, she would be nominated for an Academy Award and receive a Golden Globe. Her next film would be Sob o Dom\u00ednio do Mal (1962), in which she starred with Frank Sinatra. For the rest of the decade, her appearances in films would be rare, but she worked with Paul Newman in O Ca\u00e7ador de Aventuras (1966). In the 1970s she appeared on the small screen in a number of made-for-TV movies. In 1980, she appeared alongside her daughter Jamie Lee Curtis in A Bruma Assassina (1980), and later, in Halloween H20: Vinte Anos Depois (1998).

The patrician beauty of Miss Miles won her the title of \"Miss Kansas\" in 1948, leading soon to small roles in Hollywood films and television series. Fame came to the forthright, spirited Miles when she attracted the attention of two master directors, Alfred Hitchcock and John Ford. Ford cast her in the classic western Rastros de \u00d3dio (1956) and Hitchcock, who put her under personal contract and hailed her as his \"new Grace Kelly\", paired her with the great Henry Fonda in O Homem Errado (1956). Hitchcock cast Miles in the potentially star-making role of Judy Barton in Um Corpo que Cai (1958), but Miles withdrew from the film when she became pregnant. Hitchcock gave Miles a supporting role in another masterpiece Psicose (1960), as did Ford when he cast her opposite John Wayne and James Stewart in O Homem que Matou o Fac\u00ednora (1962), She also starred in such films as O Prefeito se Diverte (1957) opposite Bob Hope, A Hist\u00f3ria do FBI (1959) opposite Stewart, Esquina do Pecado (1961) opposite Susan Hayward and John Gavin and Clamor de Justi\u00e7a (1968) opposite Lee Marvin, as well as showing her consistently remarkable and versatile talent on dozens of popular television movies and series including The Alfred Hitchcock Hour (1962), Al\u00e9m da Imagina\u00e7\u00e3o (1959), Quinta Dimens\u00e3o (1963), O Fugitivo (1963), Meus 3 Filhos (1960), Bonanza (1959), Columbo (1971) and Assassinato por Escrito (1984). In 1983, she reprised her role as \"Lila Crane\" in the film sequel Psicose 2 (1983), starring Anthony Perkins. Although, too often, the stunningly beautiful Miles' gifts were underutilized, before her retirement in 1995, hers was a most intriguing and enduring Hollywood career.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            alfiehitchie\n          \n\n", "realName": "Vera June Ralston", "height": "161"},

His stepfather was Herald Ray Golenor. John had a fluency in Spanish that aided him in his career in diplomacy. He graduated with honors from Stanford University, majoring in Latin American economic history. \"Law, Latin America and diplomacy were my early interests,\" Gavin later remembered. Too young to participate in World War II, he did serve in the military during the Korean Conflict. He was commissioned an officer in the U.S. Navy in 1952, where he served in naval air intelligence until his 1955 discharge. After his hitch in the Navy, Universal -- the home studio of 6'5\" heartthrob Rock Hudson, who was on his way to becoming the top box office star in America -- offered the 6'4\" Gavin a screen-test and a contract with the studio. Studio bosses always liked internal competition to keep the pressure on their major stars; Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer signed Robert Taylor as a young backup to the King of Hollywood Clark Gable, and similarly, Gavin was positioned as the \"next Rock Hudson\".Tall, dark and handsome, Gavin debuted in Atr\u00e1s das Grades de Ferro (1956), and three years later, in 1959, he had his first major lead in Douglas Sirk's remake of Imita\u00e7\u00e3o da Vida (1959) opposite Lana Turner. Sirk, whose Ross Hunter-produced melodramas of the mid-1950's made Hudson a superstar, first directed Gavin in the role of a German soldier in his adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque's Amar e Morrer (1958) the year before. Imita\u00e7\u00e3o da Vida (1959), which was produced by Ross Hunter in his typical lavish style, was a huge hit. Gavin was on the road to becoming a major Hudson-style heart-throb, it seemed.The following year, Gavin achieved cinematic immortality by appearing in two classics in supporting roles, as Sam Loomis in Alfred Hitchcock's Psicose (1960) and as Julius Caesar in Stanley Kubrick's Spartacus (1960). Of Psicose (1960) and Spartacus (1960), he has said, \"I didn't have an inkling they would be classics. Had I realized that, perhaps I would have paid more attention.\" The momentum of his cinema career petered out after appearing opposite Susan Hayward in the 1961 remake of Fannie Hurst's Esquina do Pecado (1961), though he did move on to star in two television series during the 1960s, Destry (1964) and Convoy (1965). Both series were produced by companies that were subsidiaries of the Universal-M.C.A., Revue Studios and Universal TV, created by the legendary agent and studio boss Lew Wasserman, the \u00e9minence grise behind Ronald Reagan's movie, TV and political careers. More importantly, in 1961, he was appointed special adviser to the secretary general of the Organization of American States, a position he held until 1973. He also performed task-group work for the Department of State and the Executive Office of the President. From 1966 to 1973, he also served on the board of the Screen Actors Guild and was guild president from 1971-1973. For the next eight years, he was engaged in business activities, many of which took him to Mexico and other Latin American countries. The producers of the James Bond series signed him to replace George Lazenby as James Bond in 007 - Os Diamantes S\u00e3o Eternos (1971), until they convinced Sean Connery to reprise the role with a $1 million charitable contribution and a $1 million salary. Thus, Gavin lost out on what could have been his career break into the big-time. However, he did not lament the loss of the role. If he had been a more successful actor, it \"might have prevented me from fulfilling my real childhood dream: to be U.S. ambassador to Mexico.\"During the 1970s, Gavin made some more movies, toured in summer stock in a production of The Fantasticks (Gavin has a fine baritone voice), and appeared on Broadway and in the touring show of the musical Seesaw (1973). He ended the decade by starring in TV mini-series Doctors' Private Lives (1979); he left show business to pursue business interests. The 1980s brought America a new president, and on May 7, 1981, Republican Gavin was appointed Ambassador to Mexico by President Reagan, serving until June 10, 1986. The American diplomatic mission in Mexico, one of the largest in the world, employed more than 1,000 American and Mexican employees tasked by over a dozen U.S. government agencies in consulates and offices throughout Mexico.Gavin married the former stage and television actress Constance Towers in 1974. Each partner had two children from previous marriages. Gavin's daughter, Christina Gavin, followed in his footsteps and became an actress.Since leaving government service, Gavin has become a successful businessman and civic leader, co-founding and managing successful ventures in the U.S. and Latin America. In 1986, Gavin was named president of Univisa Satellite Communications, a subsidiary of Univisa, Inc. He is founder/chairman of Gamma Holdings and serves on the boards of Apex Mortgage Capital, International Wire Holdings, and KKFC. Inc, and is a trustee and director of certain Merrill Lynch mutual funds. He is also a member of the Latin America Strategy Board of Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst. Previously he was a managing director and partner of Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst (Latin America) as well as a director of Atlantic Richfield (where he had served as vice president of federal and international relations). He also served on the boards of Dresser Industries, Claxson and several other major corporations. Gavin also serves on the boards of several non-profit corporations, pro bono, including The Anderson Graduate School of Management at UCLA, Loyola Marymount University, and the California Community Foundation. Gavin also is a member of the Congressional Policy Advisory Board as a defense and foreign policy expert.Gavin served as founding Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of The Century Council's from May 1991 until December 1994, then served on the Council's Advisory Board until 1996. The Century Council, a non-profit organization dedicated to fighting alcohol abuse, focuses on drunk driving and underage drinking problems and is supported by America's leading distillers.John died on February 9, 2018 in Beverly Hills.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Jon C.

He was the son of Emma Jane (Whelan; 1863 - 1942) and East End greengrocer William Hitchcock (1862 - 1914). His parents were both of half English and half Irish ancestry. He had two older siblings, William Hitchcock (born 1890) and Eileen Hitchcock (born 1892). Raised as a strict Catholic and attending Saint Ignatius College, a school run by Jesuits, Hitch had very much of a regular upbringing. His first job outside of the family business was in 1915 as an estimator for the Henley Telegraph and Cable Company. His interest in movies began at around this time, frequently visiting the cinema and reading US trade journals.It was around 1920 when Hitchcock joined the film industry. He started off drawing the sets (he was a very skilled artist). It was there that he met Alma Reville, though they never really spoke to each other. It was only after the director for Always Tell Your Wife (1923) fell ill and Hitchcock was named director to complete the film that he and Reville began to collaborate. Hitchcock had his first real crack at directing a film, start to finish, in 1923 when he was hired to direct the film Number 13 (1922), though the production wasn't completed due to the studio's closure (he later remade it as a sound film). Hitchcock didn't give up then. He directed O Jardim dos Prazeres (1925), a British/German production, which was very popular. Hitchcock made his first trademark film in 1927, O Pensionista (1927) . In the same year, on the 2nd of December, Hitchcock married Alma Reville. They had one child, Patricia Hitchcock who was born on July 7th, 1928. His success followed when he made a number of films in Britain such as A Dama Oculta (1938) and A Estalagem Maldita (1939), some of which also gained him fame in the USA.In 1940, the Hitchcock family moved to Hollywood, where the producer David O. Selznick had hired him to direct an adaptation of 'Daphne du Maurier''s Rebecca, a Mulher Inesquec\u00edvel (1940). After Sabotador (1942), as his fame as a director grew, film companies began to refer to his films as 'Alfred Hitchcock's', for example Alfred Hitcock's Psicose (1960), Alfred Hitchcock's Trama Macabra (1976), Alfred Hitchcock's Frenesi (1972).Hitchcock was a master of pure cinema who almost never failed to reconcile aesthetics with the demands of the box-office.During the making of Frenesi (1972), Hitchcock's wife Alma suffered a paralyzing stroke which made her unable to walk very well. On March 7, 1979, Hitchcock was awarded the AFI Life Achievement Award, where he said: \"I beg permission to mention by name only four people who have given me the most affection, appreciation, and encouragement, and constant collaboration. The first of the four is a film editor, the second is a scriptwriter, the third is the mother of my daughter Pat, and the fourth is as fine a cook as ever performed miracles in a domestic kitchen and their names are Alma Reville.\" By this time, he was ill with angina and his kidneys had already started to fail. He had started to write a screenplay with Ernest Lehman called The Short Night but he fired Lehman and hired young writer David Freeman to rewrite the script. Due to Hitchcock's failing health the film was never made, but Freeman published the script after Hitchcock's death. In late 1979, Hitchcock was knighted, making him Sir Alfred Hitchcock. On the 29th April 1980, 9:17AM, he died peacefully in his sleep due to renal failure. His funeral was held in the Church of Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills. Father Thomas Sullivan led the service with over 600 people attended the service, among them were Mel Brooks (director of Alta Ansiedade (1977), a comedy tribute to Hitchcock and his films), Louis Jourdan, Karl Malden, Tippi Hedren, Janet Leigh and Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Col Needham <col@imdb.com> and Samtroy\n          \n\n", "realName": "Alfred Joseph Hitchcock", "height": "170"},

Beginning as a child star on a local Australian TV show, Russell's first big break came with two films ... the first, Skinheads - A For\u00e7a Branca (1992), gained him a name throughout the film community in Australia and the neighboring countries. The second, Um Caso de Amor (1994), helped put him on the American map, so to speak. Sharon Stone heard of him from Skinheads - A For\u00e7a Branca (1992) and wanted him for her film, R\u00e1pida e Mortal (1995). But filming on Um Caso de Amor (1994) had already begun. Sharon is reported to have held up shooting until she had her gunslinger-Crowe, for her film. With R\u00e1pida e Mortal (1995) under his belt as his first American film, the second was offered to him soon after. Assassino Virtual (1995), starring Denzel Washington, put Russell in the body of a Virtual Serial Killer, Sid6.7 ... a role unlike any he had played so far. Assassino Virtual (1995), a Sci-Fi extravaganza, was a fun film and, again, opened the door to even more American offers.

His father was an officer in the Royal Engineers and the family followed him as his career posted him throughout the United Kingdom and Europe before they eventually returned to Teesside. Scott wanted to join the Royal Army (his elder brother Frank had already joined the Merchant Navy) but his father encouraged him to develop his artistic talents instead and so he went to West Hartlepool College of Art and then London's Royal College of Art where he helped found the film department.In 1962, he joined the BBC as a trainee set designer working on several high profile series. He attended a trainee director's course while he was there and his first directing job was on an episode of the popular BBC police series Z Cars (1962), Z Cars: Error of Judgement (1965). More TV work followed until, frustrated by the poor financial rewards at the BBC, he went into advertising. With his younger brother, Tony Scott, he formed the advertising production company RSA (Ridley Scott Associates) in 1967 and spent the next 10 years making some of the best known and best loved TV adverts ever shown on British television, including a series of ads for Hovis bread set to the music of Dvorak's New World Symphony which are still talked about today (\"'e were a great baker were our dad.\")He began working with producer David Puttnam in the 1970s developing ideas for feature films. Their first joint endeavor, Os Duelistas (1977) won the Jury Prize for Best First Work at Cannes in 1977 and was nominated for the Palm d'Or, more than successfully launching Scott's feature film career. The success of Star Wars, Epis\u00f3dio IV: Uma Nova Esperan\u00e7a (1977) inspired Scott's interest in making science fiction and he accepted the offer to direct Dan O'Bannon's low budget science fiction horror movie Alien, o Oitavo Passageiro (1979), a critical and commercial success that firmly established his worldwide reputation as a movie director.Blade Runner: O Ca\u00e7ador de Androides (1982) followed in 1982 to, at best, a lukewarm reception from public and critics but in the years that followed, its reputation grew - and Scott's with it - as one of the most important sci-fi movies ever made. Scott's next major project was back in the advertising world where he created another of the most talked-about advertising spots in broadcast history when his \"1984\"-inspired ad for the new Apple Macintosh computer was aired during the Super Bowl on January 22, 1984. Scott's movie career has seen a few flops (notably A Lenda (1985) and 1492: A Conquista do Para\u00edso (1992)), but with successes like Thelma & Louise (1991), Gladiador (2000) and Falc\u00e3o Negro em Perigo (2001) to offset them, his reputation remains solidly intact.Ridley Scott was awarded Knight Bachelor of the Order of the British Empire at the 2003 Queen's New Year Honours for his \"substantial contribution to the British film industry\". On July 3, 2015, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Royal College of Art in a ceremony at the Royal Albert Hall in London. He was awarded the BAFTA Fellowship in 2018. BAFTA described him as \"a visionary director, one of the great British film-makers whose work has made an indelible mark on the history of cinema. Forty years since his directorial debut, his films continue to cross the boundaries of style and genre, engaging audiences and inspiring the next generation of film talent.\"\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Pedro Borges\n          \n\n", "realName": null, "height": "174"},

A Best Supporting Actor Oscar nominee for Os Infiltrados (2006) who went on to receive positive critical reviews for his performance in O Vencedor (2010), Wahlberg also is a solid comedy actor, proven by his starring role in Ted (2012).Mark Robert Michael Wahlberg was born June 5, 1971 in a poor working class district, Dorchester, of Boston, Massachusetts. He is the son of Alma Elaine (Donnelly), a nurse's aide and clerk, and Donald Edward Wahlberg, a delivery driver. Wahlberg is the youngest of nine children. He is of Swedish (from his paternal grandfather), French-Canadian, English, Irish and Scottish, descent. The large Wahlberg brood didn't have a lot growing up, especially after his parents divorced when he was eleven. The kids crammed into a three-bedroom apartment, none of them having very much privacy. Mark's mother has said that after the divorce, she became very self-absorbed with her own life. She has blamed herself for her son's subsequent problems and delinquency. Wahlberg dropped out of high school at age fourteen (but later got his GED) to pursue a life of petty crime and drugs. He'd spend his days scamming and stealing, working on the odd drug deal before treating himself to the substances.The young man also had a violent streak - one which was often aimed at minorities. At age sixteen, he was convicted of assault against two Vietnamese men after he had tried to rob them. As a result of his assault conviction, he was sentenced to serve 50 days in prison at Deer Island penitentiary. Whilst there, he began working out to pass time and, when he emerged at the end of his sentence, he had gone from being a scrawny young kid to a buff young man. Wahlberg also credits jail time as being his motivation to improve his lifestyle and leave crime behind him.Around this time, his older brother Donnie Wahlberg had become an overnight teen idol as a member of the 1980s boy band New Kids on the Block. A precursor to the boy-band craze, the group was dominating the charts and were on top of their game. Mark himself had been an original member of the band but had backed out early on - uncomfortable with the squeaky clean image of the group. Donnie used his connections in the music business to help his little brother secure a recording contract, and soon the world was introduced to Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch, with Wahlberg as a bad-boy rapper who danced in his boxers. Despite a lack of singing ability, promoters took to his dance moves and a physique they knew teenage girls would love.Donnie scripted some easy songs for Mark, who collected a troupe of dancers and a DJ to become his \"Funky Bunch\" and \"Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch\" was born. His debut album, \"Music for the People\", was a smash hit, which was propelled along by the rapper's willingness to disrobe down to boxer-briefs on stage, not to mention several catchy tunes. Teenage girls thrilled to the rapping \"bad boy\". Record producer David Geffen saw in Wahlberg a cash-cow of marketing ability. After speaking to designer Calvin Klein, Marky Mark was set up as the designer's chief underwear model.His scantily clad figure soon adorned billboards across the nation. Ironically, while the New Kids on the Block's fame was dwindling as audiences tired of their syrupy lyrics, \"Marky Mark's\" bad boy image was becoming even more of a commodity. He was constantly in the headlines (often of the tabloids) after multiple scandals. In 1992, he released a book dedicated to his penis. Wahlberg was constantly getting into rumored fights, most memorably with Madonna and her entourage at a Los Angeles party. While things were always intense, they were relatively harmless and made for enjoyable reading for the public. However, when the story of his arrest for assault (and the allegations of racism) broke in the press, things took on a decidedly darker note. People were not amused. Soon after, while on a British talk show along with rapper Shabba Ranks, he got into even more trouble. After Ranks made the statement that gays should be crucified, Wahlberg was accused of condoning the comments by his silence. Marky Mark was suddenly surrounded by charges of brutality, homophobia and racial hatred. His second album, \"You Gotta Believe\", had not been faring well and, after the charges surfaced, it plummeted from the charts.Adding to the hoopla, Wahlberg was brought to court for allegedly assaulting a security guard. He was ordered to make amends by appearing in a series of anti-bias advertisements. Humbled and humiliated by his fall from grace in the music world, Wahlberg decided to pursue another angle, acting. He dropped the \"Marky Mark\" moniker and became known simply as Mark Wahlberg. His first big screen role came in Penny Marshall's Um Novo Homem (1994). Despite the name change, many people snickered at the idea of the has-been rapper thinking he could make it as an actor. From the get-go, he was proving them wrong. In Um Novo Homem (1994), he gave an utterly charming performance as a simple but sincere army recruit. What naysayers remained found it increasingly difficult to write Mark Wahlberg off as he delivered one fine performance after another. He blew them away in the controversial Di\u00e1rio de um Adolescente (1995) and chilled them in Medo (1996) as every father's worst nightmare.The major turning point in Wahlberg's career came with the role of troubled porn star Dirk Diggler in Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights: Prazer Sem Limites (1997). Since then, Wahlberg has chosen roles that demonstrate a wide range of dramatic ability, starring in critically acclaimed dramas such as Tr\u00eas Reis (1999) and Mar em F\u00faria (2000), popcorn flicks like O Planeta dos Macacos (2001) and Contrabando (2012), and even indies such as Huckabees: A Vida \u00e9 uma Com\u00e9dia (2004).Wahlberg was the executive producer of such television series as Boardwalk Empire: O Imp\u00e9rio do Contrabando (2010), Em Terapia (2008) and the highly successful comedy Entourage: Fama & Amizade (2004), which was partly based on his experiences in Hollywood.Wahlberg and his wife Rhea Durham have four children.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Anonymous and Julianna_Peterson@yahoo.com\n          \n\n", "realName": "Mark Robert Michael Wahlberg", "height": "173"},

One of his teachers was impressed with the young man and recommended him to director Henry Hathaway, resulting in Bronson making his film debut in Agora Estamos na Marinha (1951).He appeared on screen often early in his career, though usually uncredited. However, he made an impact on audiences as the evil assistant to Vincent Price in the 3-D thriller Museu de Cera (1953). His sinewy yet muscular physique got him cast in action-type roles, often without a shirt to highlight his manly frame. He received positive notices from critics for his performances in Vera Cruz (1954), A Hora Zero (1955) and Renegando o Meu Sangue (1957). Indie director Roger Corman cast him as the lead in his well-received low-budget gangster flick Dominados Pelo \u00d3dio (1958), then Bronson scored the lead in his own TV series, Man with a Camera (1958). The 1960s proved to be the era in which Bronson made his reputation as a man of few words but much action.Director John Sturges cast him as half Irish/half Mexican gunslinger Bernardo O'Reilly in the smash hit western Sete Homens e um Destino (1960), and hired him again as tunnel rat Danny Velinski for the WWII POW big-budget epic Fugindo do Inferno (1963). Several more strong roles followed, then once again he was back in military uniform, alongside Lee Marvin and Ernest Borgnine in the testosterone-filled Os Doze Condenados (1967).European audiences had taken a shine to his minimalist acting style, and he headed to the Continent to star in several action-oriented films, including Os Canh\u00f5es de San Sebastian (1968) (aka \"Guns for San Sebastian\"), the cult western Era uma Vez no Oeste (1968) (aka \"Once Upon a Time in The West\"), O Passageiro da Chuva (1970) (aka \"Rider On The Rain\") and, in one of the quirkier examples of international casting, alongside Japansese screen legend Toshir\u00f4 Mifune in the western Sol Vermelho (1971) (aka \"Red Sun\").American audiences were by now keen to see Bronson back on US soil, and he returned triumphantly in the early 1970s to take the lead in more hard-edged crime and western dramas, including O Segredo da Cosa Nostra (1972) and the revenge western Renegado Vingador (1972). After nearly 25 years as a working actor, he became an 'overnight\" sensation. Bronson then hooked up with British director Michael Winner to star in several highly successful urban crime thrillers, including Assassino a Pre\u00e7o Fixo (1972) and Jogo Sujo (1973). He then scored a solid hit as a Colorado melon farmer-done-wrong in Richard Fleischer's Desafiando o Assassino (1974). However, the film that proved to be a breakthrough for both Bronson and Winner came in 1974 with the release of the controversial Desejo de Matar (1974) (written with Henry Fonda in mind, who turned it down because he was disgusted by the script).The US was at the time in the midst of rising street crime, and audiences flocked to see a story about a mild-mannered architect who seeks revenge for the murder of his wife and rape of his daughter by gunning down hoods, rapists and killers on the streets of New York City. So popular was the film that it spawned four sequels over the next 20 years.Action fans could not get enough of tough guy Bronson, and he appeared in what many fans--and critics--consider his best role: Depression-era street fighter Chaney alongside James Coburn in Lutador de Rua (1975). That was followed by the somewhat slow-paced western O Trem da Morte (1975) (with wife Jill Ireland), the light-hearted romp (a flop) O Grande Assalto (1976) and as Soviet agent Grigori Borsov in director Don Siegel's Cold War thriller O Telefone (1977).Bronson remained busy throughout the 1980s, with most of his films taking a more violent tone, and he was pitched as an avenging angel eradicating evildoers in films like the Dez Minutos para Morrer (1983), Justi\u00e7a Selvagem (1984), Assassinato nos Estados Unidos (1987) and Kinjite: Desejos Proibidos (1989). Bronson jolted many critics with his forceful work as murdered United Mine Workers leader Jock Yablonski in the TV movie Sindicato da Viol\u00eancia (1986), gave a very interesting performance in the Sean Penn-directed Unidos Pelo Sangue (1991) and surprised everyone with his appearance as compassionate newspaper editor Francis Church in the family film Papai Noel Existe! (1991).Bronson's final film roles were as police commissioner Paul Fein in a well-received trio of crime/drama TV movies \u00c0 Queima Roupa (1995), \u00c0 Queima Roupa 2 (1997) and \u00c0 Queima Roupa 3 (1999). Unfortunately, ill health began to take its toll; he suffered from Alzheimer's disease for the last few years of his life, and finally passed away from pneumonia at Los Angeles' Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in August 2003.Bronson was a true icon of international cinema; critics had few good things to say about his films, but he remained a fan favorite in both the US and abroad for 50 years, a claim few other film legends can make.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            firehouse44@hotmail.com (qv's & corrections by A.

She made her professional acting debut at the age of eight in the off-Broadway production of \"Sophistry\" with Ethan Hawke, at New York's Playwrights Horizons. She would audition for commercials but took rejection so hard her mother began limiting her to film tryouts. She made her film debut at the age of nine, as John Ritter's character's daughter in the fantasy comedy O Anjo da Guarda (1994). Following minor roles in Justa Causa (1995), as the daughter of Sean Connery and Kate Capshaw's character, and Lado a Lado com o Amor (1996), she played the role of Amanda in Meninas de Ningu\u00e9m (1996).

Bogart was educated at Trinity School, NYC, and was sent to Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, in preparation for medical studies at Yale. He was expelled from Phillips and joined the U.S. Naval Reserve. From 1920 to 1922, he managed a stage company owned by family friend William A. Brady (the father of actress Alice Brady), performing a variety of tasks at Brady's film studio in New York. He then began regular stage performances. Alexander Woollcott described his acting in a 1922 play as inadequate. In 1930, he gained a contract with Fox, his feature film debut in a ten-minute short, Broadway's Like That (1930), co-starring Ruth Etting and Joan Blondell. Fox released him after two years. After five years of stage and minor film roles, he had his breakthrough role in A Floresta Petrificada (1936) from Warner Bros. He won the part over Edward G. Robinson only after the star, Leslie Howard, threatened Warner Bros. that he would quit unless Bogart was given the key role of Duke Mantee, which he had played in the Broadway production with Howard. The film was a major success and led to a long-term contract with Warner Bros. From 1936 to 1940, Bogart appeared in 28 films, usually as a gangster, twice in Westerns and even a horror film. His landmark year was 1941 (often capitalizing on parts George Raft had stupidly rejected) with roles in classics such as Seu \u00daltimo Ref\u00fagio (1941) and as Sam Spade in one of his most fondly remembered films, Rel\u00edquia Macabra (1941). These were followed by Casablanca (1942), \u00c0 Beira do Abismo (1946), and Paix\u00f5es em F\u00faria (1948). Bogart, despite his erratic education, was incredibly well-read and he favored writers and intellectuals within his small circle of friends. In 1947, he joined wife Lauren Bacall and other actors protesting the House Un-American Activities Committee witch hunts. He also formed his own production company, and the next year made O Tesouro da Sierra Madre (1948). Bogie won the best actor Academy Award for Uma Aventura na \u00c1frica (1951) and was nominated for Casablanca (1942) and as Captain Queeg in A Nave da Revolta (1954), a film made when he was already seriously ill.

Her natural and unpretentious beauty and her immense acting talent made her one of the most celebrated figures in the history of American cinema. Bergman is also one of the most Oscar-awarded actresses, tied with Meryl Streep, both second only to Katharine Hepburn.Ingrid Bergman was born on August 29, 1915 in Stockholm, Sweden, to a German mother, Frieda Henrietta (Adler), and a Swedish father, Justus Samuel Bergman, an artist and photographer. Her mother died when she was only two and her father died when she was 12. She went to live with an elderly uncle.The woman who would be one of the top stars in Hollywood in the 1940s had decided to become an actress after finishing her formal schooling. She had had a taste of acting at age 17 when she played an uncredited role of a girl standing in line in the Swedish film Landskamp (1932) in 1932 - not much of a beginning for a girl who would be known as \"Sweden's illustrious gift to Hollywood.\" Her parents died when she was just a girl and the uncle she lived with didn't want to stand in the way of Ingrid's dream. The next year she enrolled at the Royal Dramatic Theatre School in Stockholm but decided that stage acting was not for her. It would be three more years before she would have another chance at a film. When she did, it was more than just a bit part. The film in question was O Conde de Munkbro (1935), where she had a speaking part as Elsa Edlund. After several films that year that established her as a class actress, Ingrid appeared in Intermezzo: Uma Hist\u00f3ria de Amor (1936) as Anita Hoffman. Luckily for her, American producer David O. Selznick saw it and sent a representative from Selznick International Pictures to gain rights to the story and have Ingrid signed to a contract. Once signed, she came to California and starred in United Artists' 1939 remake of her 1936 film, Intermezzo: Uma Hist\u00f3ria de Amor (1939), reprising her original role. The film was a hit and so was Ingrid.Her beauty was unlike anything the movie industry had seen before and her acting was superb. Hollywood was about to find out that they had the most versatile actress the industry had ever seen. Here was a woman who truly cared about the craft she represented. The public fell in love with her. Ingrid was under contract to go back to Sweden to film Esta Noite Contigo (1939) in 1939 and Uma Noite em Junho (1940) in 1940. Back in the US she appeared in three films, all well-received. She made only one film in 1942, but it was the classic Casablanca (1942) opposite Humphrey Bogart.Ingrid was choosing her roles well. In 1943 she was nominated for an Academy Award for her role in Por Quem os Sinos Dobram (1943), the only film she made that year. The critics and public didn't forget her when she made \u00c0 Meia Luz (1944) the following year--her role of Paula Alquist got her the Oscar for Best Actress. In 1945 Ingrid played in Quando Fala o Cora\u00e7\u00e3o (1945), Mulher Ex\u00f3tica (1945) and Os Sinos de Santa Maria (1945), for which she received her third Oscar nomination for her role of Sister Benedict. She made no films in 1947, but bounced back with a fourth nomination for Joana D'Arc (1948). In 1949 she went to Italy to film Stromboli (1950), directed by Roberto Rossellini. She fell in love with him and left her husband, Dr. Peter Lindstrom, and daughter, Pia Lindstr\u00f6m. America's \"moral guardians\" in the press and the pulpits were outraged. She was pregnant and decided to remain in Italy, where her son was born. In 1952 Ingrid had twins, Isotta and Isabella Rossellini, who became an outstanding actress in her own right, as did Pia.Ingrid continued to make films in Italy and finally returned to Hollywood in 1956 in the title role in Anastacia, a Princesa Esquecida (1956), which was filmed in England. For this she won her second Academy Award. She had scarcely missed a beat. Ingrid continued to bounce between Europe and the US making movies, and fine ones at that. A film with Ingrid Bergman was sure to be a quality production. In her final big-screen performance in 1978's Sonata de Outono (1978) she had her final Academy Award nomination. Though she didn't win, many felt it was the most sterling performance of her career. Ingrid retired, but not before she gave an outstanding performance in the mini-series Golda (1982), a film about Israeli prime minister Golda Meir. For this she won an Emmy Award as Best Actress, but, unfortunately, she did not live to see the fruits of her labor.Ingrid died from cancer on August 29, 1982, her 67th birthday, in London, England.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Denny Jackson and naim81@bluehyppo.com\n          \n\n", "realName": null, "height": "175"},

He was the son of Marie Luise Heilig (Lendecke) and Baron Karl Alphons Hernreid. His father was an aristocratic banker, who was born to a Jewish family whose surname was changed from Hirsch to Hernreid.Paul grew up in Vienna and studied at the prestigious Maria Theresa Academy (graduating in 1927) and the Institute of Graphic Arts. For four years, he worked as translator and book designer for a publishing outfit run by Otto Preminger, while training to be an actor at night. Preminger was also a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 (and managing director) of Max Reinhardt. After attending one of Henreid's acting school performances, Preminger introduced him to the famous stage director and this led to a contract. In 1933, Paul made his debut at the Reinhardt Theatre in \"Faust\". He subsequently had several leading roles on the stage and appeared in a couple of Austrian films. Paul, like his character Victor Laszlo in Casablanca (1942), was avidly anti-fascist. He accordingly left continental Europe and went to London in 1935, first appearing on stage as Prince Albert in \"Victoria the Great\" two years later.Henreid made his English-speaking motion picture debut in the popular drama Adeus, Mr. Chips (1939), as the sympathetic German master Max Staefel, who proves to be Chipping's truest friend and ally. After that, however, he became incongruously typecast as Nazi henchmen in Invas\u00e3o (1940) and Gestapo (1940). That year, he moved to the United States (becoming a citizen the following year) and quickly established himself on Broadway with \"Flight to the West\", as a Ribbentrop-type Nazi consul. His powerful performance led to radio work in the serial \"Joyce Jordan-Girl Interne\" and a film contract with RKO in 1941.This marked a turning point in Paul Henreid's career. He finally escaped the stereotypical Teutonic image and began to play heroic or romantic leads, his first being E as Luzes Brilhar\u00e3o Outra Vez (1942), opposite Mich\u00e8le Morgan, as French RAF pilot Paul Lavallier. Significantly, his next film, A Estranha Passageira (1942), defined his new screen persona: debonnaire, cultured and genteel, lighting two cigarettes simultaneously, then passing one to Bette Davis. According to Henreid, this legendary (and later often lampooned) scene was almost cut from the film because the director, Irving Rapper, had concerns about it. Next came \"Casablanca\", where Henreid played the idealistic, sensitive patriot Victor Laszlo; the poorly received Bronte sisters biopic Devo\u00e7\u00e3o (1946), as an Irish priest; and a stalwart performance as a Polish count and Ida Lupino's love interest, Viveremos Outra Vez (1944).After several dull romantic leads, Henreid reinvented himself yet again. He played a memorably athletic and lively Dutch pirate, the 'Barracuda', in RKO's colourful swashbuckler O Pirata dos Sete Mares (1945). Another of his best later performances was as a sadistic South African commandant in the underrated film noir Zona Proibida (1949), which re-united him with his former \"Casablanca\" co-stars Peter Lorre and Claude Rains. After the Arabian Technicolor adventure, A Princesa de Damasco (1952), Henreid's star began to fade. His last noteworthy appearance during the fifties was as an itinerant magician in the oriental extravaganza A V\u00eanus de Bagd\u00e1 (1953) . The most memorable of several in-jokes, had Henreid lighting two hookahs (water pipes) for one of his harem girls, spoofing his famous scene from \"Now, Voyager\".Outspoken in his opposition to McCarthyism and adhering to his rights under the First Amendment, he was subsequently blacklisted as a \"communist sympathizer\" by the House Committee on Un- American Activities. In spite of the damage this did to his career, he re-emerged as a director of second features and television episodes for Screen Gems, Desilu and other companies. In 1957, Alfred Hitchcock (in defiance of the blacklist) hired him to direct several episodes of Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1955). Towards the end of his career, Paul Henreid directed his former \"Now, Voyager\" co-star Bette Davis in the camp melodrama Algu\u00e9m Morreu em Meu Lugar (1964) and toured with Agnes Moorehead on stage in a short-lived revival of \"Don Juan in Hell\"(1972- 73). Henreid died of pneumonia in a Santa Monica hospital in April 1992, after having suffered a stroke. He has the distinction of having not just one but two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one for his films, and one for his television work.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            I.S.Mowis\n          \n\n", "realName": "Paul Georg Julius Hernreid Ritter von Wassel-Waldingau", "height": "189"},
		{"id": 204, "artistName": "Claude Rains", "birthPlace": "Clapham, London, England, UK", "birthDate": "1889-11-10", "deathDate": "1967-05-30", "pictureurl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQwNDc3NjQ1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjQ0NjI5Nw@@._V1_.jpg", "bio": "\n\n              William Claude Rains, born in the Clapham area of London, was the son of the British stage actor Frederick Rains. The younger Rains followed, making his stage debut at the age of eleven in \"Nell of Old Drury.\" Growing up in the world of theater, he saw not only acting up close but the down-to-earth business end as well, progressing from a page boy to a stage manager during his well-rounded learning experience. Rains decided to come to America in 1913 and the New York theater, but with the outbreak of World War I the next year, he returned to serve with a Scottish regiment in Europe. He remained in England, honing his acting talents, bolstered with instruction patronized by the founder of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, Herbert Beerbohm Tree. It was not long before his talent garnered him acknowledgment as one of the leading stage actors on the London scene. His one and only silent film venture was British with a small part for him, the forgettable -- Build Thy House (1920).In the meantime, Rains was in demand as acting teacher as well, and he taught at the Royal Academy. Young and eager Laurence Olivier and John Gielgud were perhaps his best known students. Rains did return to New York in 1927 to begin what would be nearly 20 Broadway roles. While working for the Theater Guild, he was offered a screen test with Universal Pictures in 1932. Rains had a unique and solid British voice-deep, slightly rasping -- but richly dynamic. And as a man of small stature, the combination was immediately intriguing. Universal was embarking on its new-found role as horror film factory, and they were looking for someone unique for their next outing, O Homem Invis\u00edvel (1933). Rains was the very man. He took the role by the ears, churning up a rasping malice and volume in his voice to achieve a bone chilling persona of the disembodied mad doctor. He could also throw out a high-pitched maniac laugh that would make you leave the lights on before going to bed. True to Universal's formula mentality, it cast him in similar roles through 1934 with some respite in more diverse film roles -- and further relieved by Broadway roles (1933, 1934) for the remainder of his contract. By 1936, he was at Warner Bros. with its ambitious laundry list of literary epics in full swing. His acting was superb, and his eyes could say as much as his voice. And his mouth could take on both a forbidding scowl and the warmest of smiles in an instant. His malicious, gouty Don Luis in Adversidade (1936) was inspired. After a shear lucky opportunity to dispatch his young wife's lover, Louis Hayward, in a duel, he triumphs over her in a scene with derisive, bulging eyes and that high pitched laugh -- with appropriate shadow and light backdrop -- that is unforgettable.He was kept very busy through the remainder of the 1930s with a mix of benign and devious historical, literary, and contemporary characters always adapting a different nuance -- from murmur to growl -- of that voice to become the person. He culminated the decade with his complex, ethics-tortured Senator \"Joe\" Paine in A Mulher Faz o Homem (1939). That year he became an American citizen. Into the 1940s, Rains had risen to perhaps unique stature: a supporting actor who had achieved A-list stardom -- almost in a category by himself. His some 40 films during that period ranged from subtle comedy to psychological drama with a bit of horror revisited; many would be golden era classics. He was the firm but thoroughly sympathetic Dr. Jaquith in A Estranha Passageira (1942) and the smoothly sardonic but engaging Capt. Louis Renault -- perhaps his best known role -- in Casablanca (1942). He was the surreptitiously nervous and malignant Alexander Sebastian in Interl\u00fadio (1946) and the egotistical and domineering conductor Alexander Hollenius in Que o C\u00e9u a Condene (1946). He was the disfigured O Fantasma da \u00d3pera (1943) as well. He played opposite the challenging Bette Davis in three movies through the decade and came out her equal in acting virtuosity. He was nominated four times for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar -- but incredibly never won. With the 1950s the few movies left to an older Rains were countered by venturing into new acting territory -- television. His haunted, suicidal writer Paul DeLambre in the mountaineering adventure Neve e Sangue (1950), though a modest part, was perhaps the most vigorously memorable film role of his last years. He made a triumphant Broadway return in 1951's \"Darkness at Noon.\"Rains embraced the innovative TV playhouse circuit with nearly 20 roles. As a favored 'Alfred Hitchcock' alumnus, he starred in five Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1955) suspense dramas into the 1960s. And he did not shy away from episodic TV either with some memorable roles that still reflected the power of Claude Rains as consummate actor -- for many, first among peers with that hallowed title.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            William McPeak\n          \n\n", "realName": "William Claude Rains", "height": "169"},

Her girlhood was uneventful for the most part, but one of the things she desired was to become an actress which she had decided on at an early age. After her high school graduation in 1947, Grace struck out on her own, heading to New York's bright lights to try her luck there. Grace worked some as a model and made her debut on Broadway in 1949. She also made a brief foray into the infant medium of television. Not content with the work in New York, Grace moved to Southern California for the more prestigious part of acting -- motion pictures. In 1951, she appeared in her first film entitled Horas Intermin\u00e1veis (1951) when she was 22. It was a small part, but a start nonetheless. The following year she landed the role of Amy Kane in Matar ou Morrer (1952), a western starring Gary Cooper and Lloyd Bridges which turned out to be very popular. In 1953, Grace appeared in only one film, but it was another popular one. The film was Mogambo (1953) where Grace played Linda Nordley. The film was a jungle drama in which fellow cast members, Clark Gable and Ava Gardner turned in masterful performances. It was also one of the best films ever released by MGM. Although she got noticed with High Noon, her work with director Alfred Hitchcock, which began with Disque M para Matar (1954) made her a star. Her standout performance in Janela Indiscreta (1954) brought her to prominence. As Lisa Fremont, she was cast opposite James Stewart, who played a crippled photographer who witnesses a murder in the next apartment from his wheelchair. Grace stayed busy in 1954 appearing in five films. Grace would forever be immortalized by winning the Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of Georgie Elgin opposite Bing Crosby in Amar \u00e9 Sofrer (1954). In 1955, Grace once again teamed with Hitchcock in Ladr\u00e3o de Casaca (1955) co-starring Cary Grant. In 1956, she played Tracy Lord in the musical comedy Alta Sociedade (1956) which also starred Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby. The whimsical tale ended with her re-marrying her former husband, played by Crosby. The film was well received. It also turned out to be her final acting performance. Grace had recently met and married Prince Rainier of the little principality of Monaco. By becoming a princess, she gave up her career. For the rest of her life, she was to remain in the news with her marriage and her three children. On September 14, 1982, Grace was killed in an automobile accident in her adoptive home country. She was just 52 years old.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Denny Jackson\n          \n\n", "realName": "Grace Patricia Kelly", "height": "169"},

Born on March 20, 1914 in Dracut, Massachusetts, in the northeastern part of the Commonwealth near the New Hampshire border, Corey was the son of a Congregationalist clergyman. After receiving his education, Corey began his acting career in summer stock. During the Depression he worked with the Federal Theater Project, part of the Works Progress Administration that had been created by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to put the unemployed to work. It was while working with the Federal Theater Project in the late 1930s that he met his wife, Alice Wiley.He made his Broadway debut in \"Comes the Revelation\" in 1942, a flop that lasted only two performances. His next play, \"Strip for Action\" (1942-43), was more successful, lasting 110 performances. He appeared in more plays in supporting roles from 1943-45, before making his reputation as the cynical newspaperman in Elmer Rice's hit comedy \"Dream Girl,\" which ran for 341 performances in the 1945-46 season. He was discovered during the run of the play by producer Hal B. Wallis, the former head of production at Warner Bros. who was an independent producer affiliated with Paramount Pictures. Wallis, who discovered Burt Lancaster shortly after the war, signed Corey to a Paramount contract.It was at Paramount that he made his movie debut in A Filha da Pecadora (1947). He went on to a career as a supporting player in the '40s and '50s in A-level productions with top Hollywood stars. He also carved a niche for himself in television and in the late 1950s starred in the TV series Peck's Bad Girl (1959). In the 1960s he worked mostly in television.Like Ronald Reagan, who was then a Democrat, the Republican Corey was interested in politics. He was elected to membership on the board of directors of the Screen Actors Guild and served as president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences from 1961 to 1963. As a Republican, he was elected to the City Council in Santa Monica, California, in 1965. He made a bid for the Republican nomination to contest a seat in Congress in 1966, but was defeated in the primary.Corey was still serving on the Santa Monica City Council when he died on November 8, 1968 at the Motion Picture & Television Hospital in Woodland Hills, California.

His father was fond of literature. Young Noiret attended the College Janson-of-Sally in the 16th arrondissement in Paris. At school, he was more interested in acting than in academics; he failed to pass his baccalaureate exams three times and left school without graduation. He studied acting at the Centre Dramatique de l'Ouest (Western Drama Theatre). There, in 1950, Noiret made his debut sharing the stage with G\u00e9rard Philipe under directorship of Roger Blin. From 1953-1960 Noiret was a permanent member of the troupe with the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre National Populaire (TNP) in Paris. There he played over 40 roles in seven years under directorship of Jean Vilar. While there he met actress Monique Chaumette, whom he married in 1962, and they had one daughter, Frederique. At that time Noiret continued his acting career as a stand-up comedian and a night club entertainer.Noiret made his big screen debut playing bit part in O Brotinho e as Respeitosas (1949), then earned his first on-screen credit in Agence matrimoniale (1952). He landed his first leading role as Lui, a government inspector, in the French New Wave film La Pointe-Courte (1955) by notable female director Agn\u00e8s Varda. His first big success came in 1960 with Louis Malle's film Zazie no Metr\u00f4 (1960) (aka.. Zazie in the Metro). In 1968 he became a star in France with the title role in Alexandre, O Felizardo (1968). After that success, Noiret moved on with his acting career and devoted himself almost entirely to the big screen. Noiret's trademark hangdog face and his range allowed him to portray a middle-class man or an aristocrat, but not a handsome romantic hero, so he was cast primarily as the Everyman character. In A Comilan\u00e7a (1973), an allegoric film about sex orgy and suicide by overeating, which caused a scandal at Cannes in 1973, Noiret co-starred in a controversial role as suicidal judge Philippe, alongside Marcello Mastroianni.Philippe Noiret shot to international fame with the supporting role as Alfredo, an old man who is a small town projectionist who befriends and inspires a young boy, in Cinema Paradiso (1988). He received international acclaim for his portrayal of the exiled Chilean poet Pablo Neruda in O Carteiro e o Poeta (1994) by director Michael Radford. Noiret won two Cesar Awards (the French equivalent of the Oscars) and earned three more Cesar nominations. In 1976 he won his first Cesar for his exceptional performance as Julien Dandieu, a surgeon who kills the Nazis in revenge for the death of his wife and daughter, in O Velho Fuzil (1975) (aka.. The Old Gun). Noiret won his second Cesar for the leading role as Major Delaplane in A Vida e Nada Mais (1989) (aka.. Life and Nothing But) in 1990. Over the years, Noiret worked with all of the France's top directors. He also made excellent radio performances and popular books readings, which he narrated with his serious voice and impeccable diction. He was decorated with the Knight of the Legion of Honor.Philippe Noiret was also known as an elegant hedonist and an avid dog lover. His other interests outside of the acting profession included art, horses, gourmet cuisine and cigars. For about 30 years he resided in his country house in the wine country near Carcassonne, in the South of France, where he generously supported the local causes. Noiret died of generalized complications of cancer on November 23, 2006, in a hospital, in Paris, and was laid to rest in Cimeti\u00e8re du Monparnasse in Paris, France.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Steve Shelokhonov\n          \n\n", "realName": null, "height": "185"},

Her father, TV producer Sylvester L. Weaver Jr., originally wanted to name her Flavia, because of his passion for Roman history (he had already named her elder brother Trajan). Her mother, Elizabeth Inglis (n\u00e9e Desiree Mary Lucy Hawkins), was an English actress who had sacrificed her career for a family. Sigourney grew up in a virtual bubble of guiltless bliss, being taken care of by nannies and maids. By 1959, the Weavers had resided in 30 different households. In 1961, Sigourney began attending the Brearley Girls Academy, but her mother moved her to another New York private school, Chapin. Sigourney was quite rather taller than most of her other classmates (at age 13, she was already 5' 10\"), resulting in her constantly being laughed at and picked on; in order to gain their acceptance, she took on the role of class clown.In 1962, her family moved to San Francisco briefly, an unpleasant experience for her. Later, they moved back east to Connecticut, where she became a student at the Ethel Walker School, facing the same problems as before. In 1963, she changed her name to \"Sigourney\", after the character Sigourney Howard in F. Scott Fitzgerald's \"The Great Gatsby\" (her own birth name, Susan, was in honor of her mother's best friend, explorer Susan Pretzlik). Sigourney had already starred in a school drama production of \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", and, in 1965, she worked during the summer with a stock troupe, performing in \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" and \"You Can't Take It With You\" (she did not star in the latter because she was taller than the lead actor). After graduating from school in 1967, she spent some months in a kibbutz in Israel. At that time, she became engaged to reporter Aaron Latham, but they soon separated.In 1969, Sigourney enrolled in Stanford University, majoring in English Literature. She also participated in school plays, especially Japanese Noh plays. By that time, she was living in a tree house, alongside a male friend, dressed in elf-like clothes! After completing her studies in 1971, she applied for the Yale School of Drama in New Haven. Despite appearing at the audition reading a Bertolt Brecht speech and wearing a rope-like belt, she was accepted by the school but her professors rejected her, because of her height, and kept typecasting her as prostitutes and old women (whereas classmate Meryl Streep was treated almost reverently). However, in 1973, while making her theatrical debut with \"Watergate Classics\", she met up with a team of playwrights and actors and began hanging around with them, resulting in long-term friendships with Christopher Durang, Kate McGregor-Stewart and Albert Innaurato.In 1974, she starred in such plays as Aristophanes' \"Frogs\" and Durang's \"The Nature and Purpose of the Universe\" and \"Daryl and Carol and Kenny and Jenny\", as \"Jenny\". After finishing her studies that year, she began seriously pursuing a stage career, but her height kept being a hindrance. However, she continued working on stage with Durang (in \"Titanic\" [1975]) and Innaurato (in \"Gemini\" [1976]). Other 1970s stage works included \"Marco Polo Sing a Song\", \"The Animal Kingdom\", \"A Flea in Her Ear\", \"The Constant Husband\", \"Conjuring an Event\" and others. However, the one that really got her noticed was \"Das Lusitania Songspiel\", a play she co-wrote with Durang and in which she starred for two seasons, from 1979 to 1981. She was also up for a Drama Desk Award for it. During the mid-1970s, she appeared in several TV spots and even starred as Avis Ryan on the soap opera Somerset (1970).In 1977, she was cast in the role Shelley Duvall finally played in Noivo Neur\u00f3tico, Noiva Nervosa (1977), after rejecting the role due to prior stage commitments. In the end, however, Woody Allen offered her a role in the film that, while short (she was on-screen for six seconds), made many people sit up and take notice. She later appeared in Madman (1978) and, of course, Alien, o Oitavo Passageiro (1979). The role of the tough, uncompromising Ripley made Sigourney an overnight star and brought her a British Award nomination. She next appeared in Testemunha Fatal (1981) and O Ano que Vivemos em Perigo (1982), the latter being a great success in Australia that won an Oscar and brought Sigourney and co-star Mel Gibson to Cannes in 1983. The same year she delivered an honorary Emmy Award to her father, a few months before her uncle, actor Doodles Weaver, committed suicide. That year also brought her a romance with Jim Simpson, her first since having broken up two years previously with James M. McClure. She and Simpson were married on 1 October 1984. Meanwhile, Sigourney had played in the poorly received Uma Tacada da Pesada (1983) and the mega-hit Os Ca\u00e7a-Fantasmas (1984). She was also nominated for a Tony Award for her tour-de-force performance in the play \"Hurly Burly\". Then followed Une femme ou deux (1985), Half Moon Street (1986) and Aliens, o Resgate (1986). The latter was a huge success, and Sigourney was nominated for both a Golden Globe Award and an Oscar.She then entered her most productive career period and snatched Academy Award nominations, in both Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress categories, for her intense portrayal of Dian Fossey in Nas Montanhas dos Gorilas (1988) and her delicious performance as a double-crossing, power-hungry corporate executive in Uma Secret\u00e1ria de Futuro (1988). She ended up losing in both, but made up for it to a degree by winning both Golden Globe Awards. After appearing in a documentary about fashion photographer Helmut Newton, Helmut Newton: Frames from the Edge (1989), and reprising her role in the sequel Os Ca\u00e7a-Fantasmas 2 (1989), she discovered she was pregnant and retired from public life for a while. She gave birth to her daughter, Charlotte Simpson, on 13 April 1990, and returned to the movies as a now skinhead Ripley in Alien 3 (1992) and a gorgeous Queen Isabella of Spain in 1492: A Conquista do Para\u00edso (1992), her second film with director Ridley Scott. She starred in the political comedy Dave, Presidente por um Dia (1993) alongside Kevin Kline, and then a Roman Polanski thriller, A Morte e a Donzela (1994).In 1995, she was seen in the romantic comedy Jeffrey - De Caso Com a Vida (1995) and the mystery thriller Copycat: A Vida Imita a Morte (1995). The next year, she \"trod the boards\" in \"Sex and Longing\", yet another Durang play. She had not performed in the theater in many years before that play, her last stage performances occurring in the 1980s in \"As You Like It\" (1981), \"Beyond Therapy\" (1981), \"The Marriage of 'Bette and Boo'\" (1985) and \"The Merchant of Venice\" (1986). In 1997, she was the protagonist in Floresta Negra (1997), Tempestade de Gelo (1997) and Alien, a Ressurrei\u00e7\u00e3o (1997). Her performance in Tempestade de Gelo (1997) gained her a BAFTA Award and another Golden Globe Award nomination. She also gave excellent performances in O Mapa do Mundo (1999) and the sci-fi spoof Her\u00f3is Fora de \u00d3rbita (1999). However, her next comedy Um Agente como a Gente (2000) was not quite so warmly welcomed critically and financially. She next played a sexy con artist in Doce Trapa\u00e7a (2001) and had a voice role in Big Bad Love (2001). Her father died at age 93. Sigourney herself has recently starred in Um Jovem Sedutor (2002) and is planning a cinematic version of Os Her\u00f3is (2002), the enthralling September 11th one-act drama she played on stage on late 2001. At age 60, she played a crucial role in Avatar (2009), which became the top box-office hit of all time. The film reunited her with her Aliens, o Resgate (1986) director James Cameron. Her beauty, talent, and hard-work keeps the ageless actress going, and she has continued to win respect from her fans and directors.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            morphtzikas@netscape.net\n          \n\n", "realName": "Susan Alexandra Weaver", "height": "182"},

		{"id": 221, "artistName": "John Hurt", "birthPlace": "Chesterfield, Derbyshire, England, UK", "birthDate": "1940-01-22", "deathDate": "2017-01-25", "pictureurl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM1NTgyMTAyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTE4MjQwNA@@._V1_.jpg", "bio": "\n\n              This transatlantic talent was born John Vincent Hurt on January 22, 1940 in Shirebrook, a coal mining village near the busy market town of Chesterfield, in Derbyshire, England. He is the son of Phyllis (Massey), an engineer and one-time actress, and Arnold Herbert Hurt, an Anglican clergyman and mathematician. The youngest of three children, he spent much of his childhood in solitude. Demonstrating little initiative, he was guided into art as a possible direction. The family moved to Grimsby when he turned twelve and, despite an active early passion in acting, his parents thought less of it and enrolled him at the Grimsby Art School and St. Martin's School of Art where he showed some flourish. When he could not manage to get another scholarship to art school, his focus invariably turned to acting.Accepted into the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, John made his stage debut in 1962 and remained there in typically offbeat form such plays as \"Infanticide in the House of Fred Ginger\". An odd, somber, pasty-looking fellow with an aquiline nose (injured while playing sports) and a mass of Irish freckles, he was hardly leading man material. However, his earlier focus as a painter triggered a keen skill in the art of observation and it certainly advanced his talent for getting into the skin of his characters. His movie debut occurred that same year with a supporting role in the ill-received British \"angry young man\" drama Um Grito de Revolta (1962).Appearing in various mediums, John increased his profile (and respect) appearing in such theatre plays as \"Inadmissible Evidence\" (1965), \"Little Malcolm and His Struggle Against the Eunuchs\" (1966), a role he later took to film as Little Malcolm and His Struggle Against the Eunuchs (1974), \"Macbeth\" (as Malcolm) (1967) and \"Man and Superman\" (1969), while finding prime roles in such films as O Homem que N\u00e3o Vendeu sua Alma (1966), a role he was given after director Fred Zinnemann saw his stellar work in \"Little Malcolm\". He continued on the stage as an unlikely Romeo in 1973, and went onto garner great applause in Pinter's \"The Caretaker\" and \"The Dumb Waiter\", as well as \"Travesties\" (1974).However, it was television that displayed the full magnitude and fearless range of his acting instrument. In the mid-1970s, he gained widespread acclaim for his embodiment of the tormented gay writer and raconteur Quentin Crisp in the landmark television play Vida Nua (1975), adapted from Crisp's autobiography. Way, way ahead of its time, Hurt's bold and unabashed take on the flamboyant and controversial gent who dared to be different was rewarded with the Emmy and the British TV Awards. Far and away one of the most marvelous creations ever captured on the small screen, he was altogether unsettling, unappetizing and unforgettable. Audiences cringed but were mesmerized at the same time -- like a car wreck. He was Quentin Crisp.Doors immediately opened for John. He was handed the best roles film and television had to offer. Once again, he was strikingly disturbing as the cruel and crazed Roman emperor Caligula in the epic television masterpiece Eu, Cl\u00e1udio (1976). The chameleon in him then displayed a polar side as the gentle, pathetically disfigured title role in O Homem Elefante (1980), and when he morphed into the role of a tortured Turkish prison inmate who befriends Brad Davis in the intense drama O Expresso da Meia-Noite (1978), he was barely recognizable. The last two films earned Hurt Oscar nominations. Mainstream box-office films were offered as well as art films. He made the most of his role as a crew member whose body becomes host to an unearthly predator in Alien, o Oitavo Passageiro (1979). Who can forget the film's most notorious scene as the creature explodes from Hurt's stomach and scurries away into the bowels of the spaceship?Along with fame, of course, came a few misguided ventures generally unworthy of his talent. Such brilliant work as his steeple chase jockey in Enquanto Existir Esperan\u00e7a (1984) or kidnapper in O Traidor (1984) was occasionally offset by such drivel as the comedy misfire Dois Tiras Meio Suspeitos (1982) with Ryan O'Neal in which Hurt looked enervated and embarrassed. But those were very few and far between. As for the past couple of decades, the craggy-faced actor continues to draw extraordinary notices. Tops on the list includes his prurient governmental gadfly who triggers the Christine Keeler political sex scandal in the aptly-titled Esc\u00e2ndalo: A Hist\u00f3ria que Seduziu o Mundo (1989); the cultivated gay writer aroused and obsessed with struggling \"pretty-boy\" actor Jason Priestley in Amor E Morte (1997); and the Catholic priest embroiled in the Rwanda atrocities in Tiros em Ruanda (2005).His rich tones have also been tapped into frequently with a number of animated features and documentaries, often serving as narrator. Presently married to his fourth wife, genius is often accompanied by a darker, more self-destructive side and Hurt was no exception with alcohol being his choice of poison. He had since recovered. In 2004, he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) at the Queen's Birthday Honours for his services to drama. In 2015, he was appointed Knight Bachelor of the Order of the British Empire at the Queen's New Years Honours for his services to drama. Sir John Hurt died of pancreatic cancer in his home in Cromer, Norfolk, England on January 15, 2017, three days after his 77th birthday.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Gary Brumburgh / gr-home@pacbell.net\n          \n\n", "realName": "John Vincent Hurt", "height": "175"},

As such, she was cast as \"Jemima Boone\" in the popular television series Daniel Boone (1964), which ran from 1964 to 66. Her career after \"Daniel Boone\" may have been influenced by Hitchcock, since she appeared in both the remake of Invasores de Corpos (1978) and the horror classic Alien, o Oitavo Passageiro (1979). On television, she appeared twice as Lumpy's younger sister, \"Violet Rutherford\" and once as \"Peggy MacIntosh\" on Leave It to Beaver (1957) and had a small role in the television movie Still the Beaver (1983).Cartwright also appeared in Robert Kennedy and His Times (1985), Tanner '88 (1988) and had a recurring role on L.A.

She spent her first 10 years traveling around the country with her parents and two sisters. She was always \"the new girl in school.\" Acting did not really cross Allen's mind until she was in her early 20s, when she saw a Jerzy Grotowski theater production that impressed her so much, she instantly decided to give it a shot. She trained as a classical actress and enrolled at the Actors Studio and with Lee Strasberg in New York City. During this period, she made several student films and directed and acted in several plays. In 1976, she made her first film appearance in the award-winning small film The Whidjitmaker (1976).Her first major film role came as Katy in 1978's National Lampoon's Clube dos Cafajestes (1978), which became one of the biggest hits of the year, obtained \"classic\" status, and launched a whole host of young \"hot\" stars. However, shortly after Clube dos Cafajestes (1978) opened, Allen was struck by a rare and dangerous eyesight condition called keratoconjunctivitis. Luckily, the condition subsided and Allen could continue her dramatic rise to the top. Lead roles in cult favorites like A Gangue da Pesada (1979) and the controversial thriller Parceiros da Noite (1980) followed, as did smaller parts as in Woody Allen's Manhattan (1979). However, it was her performance in Rob Cohen's Amigo \u00e9 para Essas Coisas (1980), as well as her previously mentioned turn in Clube dos Cafajestes (1978), that caught the eye of a certain Steven Spielberg. He then cast her as the feisty heroine and co-star of Harrison Ford in his big-budget blockbuster Indiana Jones e os Ca\u00e7adores da Arca Perdida (1981), which became a huge hit in 1981-82 and is regarded by many film buffs as the greatest action-adventure film ever made.Following the huge success of Indiana Jones e os Ca\u00e7adores da Arca Perdida (1981), Allen chose to spend more than two years out of the limelight, concentrating on smaller, more personal projects. She won a major award for her performances on Broadway, won critical acclaim for her portrayal of Abra in the hugely successful ABC production of East of Eden (1981), and had parts in two smaller films: Alan Parker's A Chama que n\u00e3o Se Apaga (1982) and Seita de Fan\u00e1ticos (1982), co-starring James Woods and Peter Fonda. She returned to the mainstream in 1984 with Quando Setembro Chegar (1984) and O Homem das Estrelas (1984), co-starring Jeff Bridges and directed by John Carpenter (of Halloween: A Noite do Terror (1978) fame), but once again decided to leave the limelight for a couple of years to do more stage work and some troubled indie films. While Allen has worked almost constantly since then, giving notable performances in Paul Newman's screen adaptation of Algemas de Cristal (1987), the Christmas hit Os Fantasmas Contra Atacam (1988), and Steven Soderbergh's underrated O Inventor de Ilus\u00f5es (1993), she has not been able to scale the same dizzy heights as the early 1980s hits. Most of her lead roles in feature films since O Homem das Estrelas (1984) have not been that well-received (Uma Pesquisa Rom\u00e2ntica (1989), O Fantasma da M\u00e1quina (1993), and The Turning (1992) among them). However, she has been seen to good effect on TV in such films as Challenger - Um V\u00f4o Sem Retorno (1990), in which she portrayed tragic schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe, and All the Winters That Have Been (1997), co-starring Richard Chamberlain.She has also made special guest star appearances on such shows as Lei & Ordem (1990), Knots Landing (1979), and Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1985), and in several TV movies, including Vivendo em Perigo (1996) and A Arma Secreta (1990). She also played the lead in the CBS series The Road Home (1994). Karen Allen was married to soap star Kale Browne (with whom she co-starred in Encontro com o Destino (1997)) in 1988 and they have a son, Nicholas. Apart from acting, Allen is also an accomplished singer, songwriter, and musician. She played in a band with Kathleen Turner, and recorded a duet with Jeff Bridges for the O Homem das Estrelas (1984) soundtrack album.She also writes plays, screenplays, and poetry; owns her own Ashtanga yoga enterprise; and spends time at her Berkshire Mountains farm or Upper West Side Manhattan townhouse. The classically trained actress also has a screenplay called \"The Second Coming,\" which is about to be made into a movie. Most recently she has starred opposite Peter Coyote in O Jogo Da Esperan\u00e7a (1999), and appeared in the blockbuster Mar em F\u00faria (2000), in which she co-starred with George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, and Diane Lane. In addition to these, she is working on Guerreiro da Justi\u00e7a (2001) and recently made an independent film, Entre Quatro Paredes (2001). Karen Allen is undoubtedly one of the most talented, ambitious, and versatile actresses of the last 20 years. In many ways, her own choices to \"go back to theater and smaller projects\" are the only things that have really stopped her being a major, major star. Allen was voted one of the most beautiful women in the world in 1983, and is a naturally attractive lady - who often plays characters significantly younger than herself. She also often plays unglamorous types - and there is no one better at portraying real, human, and wholly believable people.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Tony Fontana <tony.fontana@spacebbs.com> and Anonymous\n          \n\n", "realName": "Karen Jane Allen", "height": "165"},

Films included A Noite do Terror (1980) (starring Bob Hoskins) and C\u00e3es de Guerra (1980) (starring Christopher Walken). His work was noticed by American director Steven Spielberg, who cast Freeman as French archaeologist Rene Belloq, Harrison Ford's charismatic but utterly selfish rival in the blockbuster Indiana Jones e os Ca\u00e7adores da Arca Perdida (1981). He had expected to appear in the next Indiana Jones movie, but Spielberg and George Lucas decided on a different story. Nevertheless, his portrayal of Belloq guaranteed him good work in the following years, during which he continued to showcase his command of dialects and chameleon-like ability to disappear into roles, such as the deliciously evil Professor Moriarty in the Michael Caine comedy Sherlock & Eu (1988).His notable television appearances have included Will Shakespeare (1978), Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years (1981), Falcon Crest (1981), Inspector Morse (1987), and Plant\u00e3o M\u00e9dico (1994).

Forrest had long wanted to be an actor, but he was so nervous that he ran out of auditions for school plays. Later, at Texas Christian University, he took a minor in theater arts while majoring in radio and television studies. His parents opposed his aspirations as a thespian as it was a precarious existence, but he moved on to New York and studied with renowned acting teacher Sanford Meisner. He eventually became an observer at the Actors Studio, where he was tutored by Lee Strasberg. During this time, he supported himself as a page at the NBC Studios in Rockefeller Plaza.His theatrical debut was in the Off-Broadway production of \"Viet-Rock\", an anti-war play featuring music. He became part of avant-garde director Tom O'Horgan's stock company at La Mama, appearing in the infamous \"Futz\", among other productions. After starring in the off-Broadway play \"Silhouettes\", Forrest moved with the production to Los Angeles, intent on breaking into movies. While the production ran for three months and was visited by agents bird-dogging new talent, Forrest got no offers and had to support himself as a pizza-baker after the show closed. Eventually, he began auditing classes at Actors Studio West, and director Stuart Millar saw him in a student showcase production of Clifford Odets' \"Watiting for Lefty\" and cast him in Quando Morrem as Lendas (1972). He copped a 1973 Golden Globe nomination as \"Most Promising Newcomer - Male\" for the role.Forrest landed a small but very important part in \"Godfather\" director Francis Ford Coppola's A Conversa\u00e7\u00e3o (1974). He and Cindy Williams are the two people having that titular conversation (recorded by Gene Hackman: so Forrest's voice is heard throughout the film). And Coppola wasn't done with him! Playing \"Chef\" in Apocalypse Now (1979) garnered Forrest the best notices of his career, and he parlayed that into Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations as Best Supporting Actor for A Rosa (1979), his second hit that year. He was named Best Supporting Actor by the National Society of Film Critics for both films. Then he was cast as the star in Coppola's \"One From The Heart\". In Apocalypse Now (1979), his character (\"Chef\") is yelling for the Playboy Playmates from the crowd, one of whom is played by Colleen Camp, who, four years later, would play his hippie wife in the film Sonhos Rebeldes (1983).\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Jon C.

A slapstick inspiration to future comedians like Jackie Gleason, Oakie's lightweight foolery and participation in films was pretty much standard cornball with a lot of mugging to boot, but then he surprised audiences by topping it all off in the hands of the legendary Charles Chaplin with a scene-stealing Oscar-nominated support role in a political satire masterpiece.Jack was born Lewis Delaney Offield in Sedalia, Missouri on November 12, 1903, the son of a grain dealer (who died while Jack was quite young) and a teacher of psychology (Mary Evelyn Oakie Offield). His family moved to moved to Muskogee, Oklahoma. He was raised at times with his grandmother in Kansas City, Missouri, and made extra money there as a paperboy for The Kansas City Star.Moving eventually to New York, Jack first worked as a runner for a brokerage firm on Wall Street, and nearly lost his life when a nearby Wall Street building was bombed on September 16, 1920. Interested in comedy and mime by this point, he began building up confidence on the amateur stage and giving himself a new name, Jack Oakie, which was comprised of the first character he ever played on stage and his mother's maiden name.Jack took his first professional curtain call on Broadway in 1923 as a chorus boy in George M. Cohan's production of \"Little Nellie Kelly.\" From there he found employment in a number of comedies, as well as musicals throughout the mid to late 1920s, including \"Sharlee\" (1923), the revues \"Innocent Eyes\" (1924) and \"Artists and Models\" (1925), and the musical \"Peggy-Ann\" in 1926. He also appeared in a couple of unbilled film parts in 1923 and 1924.Films came calling toward the end of the silent era in 1927, and he relocated to Los Angeles where he made several non-talkies on his arrival, including Ai, Que Cal\u00e7as! (1928) starring Laura La Plante and John Harron (Bobby's little brother) and directed by Wesley Ruggles; Clara Bow's Marinheiros em Terra (1928); and the western Sin Town (1929). With the advent of sound, Oakie was signed, with the help of director Ruggles, to a contract by Paramount and appeared in his first talkie, the Ruth Chatterton/Fredric March starrer Assim Falou o Mudo (1929). Jack went on to support Wallace Beery in A Guerra dos Tongs (1929); Dorothy Mackaill in Fraquejos de Mulher (1929); Betty Compson and John Harron in Um Trono por um Beijo (1929); and Nancy Carroll in the musical Queridinha (1929). Settling in, he never returned to the Broadway stage.Jack finally shared top billing with Evelyn Brent in the comedy film O Premio do Campe\u00e3o (1929) as Elmer Kane, a character based on the George M. Cohan Broadway show \"Elmer the Great.\" This led to top billing in the film version of the Broadway hit musical O Gal\u00e3 da Esquadra (1929), as well as the early talking comedy vehicles Le\u00e3o da Festa (1930), O Amor Atravessa o Mar (1930), Naufr\u00e1gio Amoroso (1930), Sea Legs (1930), The Gang Buster (1931), June Moon (1931), Dude Ranch (1931), Once in a Lifetime (1932), Nos Bastidores do Esporte (1932), Uptown New York (1932), Sonhos de Gl\u00f3ria (1933) and M\u00fasica, Maestro! (1934). Occasional dramas came his way with Dan\u00e7ando no Escuro (1932) co-starring Miriam Hopkins and A Noiva do C\u00e9u (1932) co-starring Richard Arlen.Throughout the 1930s, the 30-year-old plus actor appeared in a host of light college-themed comedies and was lovingly dubbed \"The World's Oldest Freshman\" while adding to the humor of such films as Mocidade e Farra (1933), Mocidade e M\u00fasica (1934) and Col\u00e9gio do Sapequismo (1936). Elsewhere, in Coquetel Musical (1933), his mother Evelyn was featured as his mother, and he played Tweedledum to Roscoe Karns' Tweedledee in the all-star version of Alice no Pa\u00eds das Maravilhas (1933).Oakie's contract ended with Paramount in 1934 and he continued as a freelancing agent until an RKO contract came his way a couple of years later. Starting to now gain a bit in girth, Oakie went back into support roles in musicals, adventures and comedies. Among the better known films were O Grito da Selva (1935) with Clark Gable and Loretta Young; Colleen, A Modista (1936) with Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler; \u00cddolo de Nova York (1937) with Edward Arnold and Frances Farmer; A Vida \u00e9 uma Can\u00e7\u00e3o (1940) with Alice Faye and Betty Grable and Bodas no Gelo (1942) with Sonja Henie and John Payne.In the late 1930s, Jack traveled to Europe for some work and suffered a huge career setback when he returned to Hollywood and found himself unwanted. The draught lasted nearly two years until a major comeback thanks to Charles Chaplin. While such film highlights must include Million Dollar Legs (1932), O Rei dos Empres\u00e1rios (1936), Os Apuros de Annabella (1938) and O Bamba da Pelota (1941), Oakie will in all probability be best remembered for his lip-smacking parody of Benito Mussolini (\"Il Duce\")in Chaplin's classic O Grande Ditador (1940). As Benzino Napaloni, the dictator of the fictional country of Bacteria, Jack earned his only Oscar nomination in the \"Supporting Actor\" category. Throughout his lead career, he worked with a quality number of diverse leading ladies on film from Carole Lombard to Lily Pons.Oakie also found work on radio, hosting his own show, \"Jack Oakie's College,\" between 1936 and 1938. His deafness did not affect the output of his work, and, as a pro, seldom were there problems in accommodating his disability. Director Jules Dassin, in fact, once made it a point to state that Oakie never caused any delays in the filming of his film noir Mercado de Ladr\u00f5es (1949).Into the 1950s and 1960s, his career slowed down quite a bit, primarily due to his disability. He appeared to good advantage in the films A Taberna das Ilus\u00f5es Perdidas (1960) and Volta Meu Amor (1961) and with TV comedy and drama on such popular shows as \"The Real McCoys,\" \"Daniel Boone,\" \"Bonanza\" and, his last, \"Night Gallery\" in 1972.Jack Oakie was married twice. His first marriage (1936-1945) was to Venita Varden, who perished in the 1948 air crash of United Airlines Flight 624 at Mount Carmel, Pennsylvania. Oakie's second marriage was to actress Victoria Horne in 1950; they moved to an estate in Northridge and lived there until his death. The USC School of Cinematic Arts continues its durable ties with Hollywood history in the form of The Jack Oakie and Victoria Horne Oakie Charitable Foundation, which provides scholarships.The comic actor died on January 23, 1978, in Los Angeles, California at the age of 74 from an aortic aneurysm. His remains were interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, in the Los Angeles area.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Gary Brumburgh / gr-home@pacbell.net\n          \n\n", "realName": "Lewis Delaney Offield", "height": "180"},

His first foray into the film business was in the Alfred Hitchcock-directed O Pensionista (1927). However, it was in Hollywood where his career really took off. At the prompting of Beatrice Lillie he departed England for America in 1935. After appearing in two of her shows he delighted Broadway audiences in \"An Evening with Beatrice Lillie and Reginald Gardiner\", performing a series of clever impersonations of such inanimate items as lighthouses and wallpaper.In 1936, he appeared in his first Hollywood film, Nasci para Dan\u00e7ar (1936) (starring Eleanor Powell and James Stewart), Gardiner playing a traffic cop with symphonic delusions. His instant popularity resulted in further film offers and he soon found himself in constant demand to impersonate butlers and \"silly ass\" upper-crust English twits. With his suave attire, thin moustache and obtuse mannerisms, he took to playing those caricatures with obvious glee. He enlivened many a film with his comic presence, most notably Cativa e Cativante (1937), Sat\u00e3 Janta Conosco (1942) (his character \"Beverly Carlton\" brilliantly lampooning No\u00ebl Coward) and O Pecado de Cluny Brown (1946). In later years, Gardiner became a regular on television as co-star of The Pruitts of Southampton (1966), and, in 1964, he returned to the stage to play Alfred P. Doolittle at the New York City Centre (the role made famous by Stanley Holloway in My Fair Lady) . John Canaday, reviewing for the New York Times, described his character as a \"wonderful, boozy, abominable, bug-ridden and altogether reprehensible charmer, a kind of defrocked Boy Scout, whose love for everybody is exceeded only by his propensity for chicanery and self-indulgence\". Gardiner was also celebrated for his classic monologue, simply called 'Trains'. It so impressed King George VI that he summoned the actor to Buckingham Palace for a special performance. 'Trains' was recorded by Decca and has since become a collector's item.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            I.S.Mowis\n          \n\n", "realName": "William Reginald Gardiner", "height": null},

Robert Evans III, a dentist. His uncle is congressman Mike Capuano. Chris's father is of half German and half Welsh/English/Scottish ancestry, while Chris's mother is of half Italian and half Irish descent. He has an older sister, Carly Evans, and two younger siblings, a brother named Scott Evans, who is also an actor, and a sister named Shana Evans. The family moved to suburban Sudbury when he was 11 years-old. Bitten by the acting bug in the first grade because his older sister, Carly, started performing, Evans followed suit and began appearing in school plays. While at Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School, his drama teacher cited his performance as \"Leontes\" in \"The Winter's Tale\" as exemplary of his skill. After more plays and regional theatre, he moved to New York and attended the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute.On the advice of friends, he landed an internship at a casting office and befriended a couple of the agents he regularly communicated with - one of whom later took him on as a client. The screen - not the stage - then became his focus; Evans soon began auditioning for feature films and television series. Evans made one of his first appearances on O Fugitivo (2000) (CBS, 2000-2001), a remake of the 1960s series and feature film starring Harrison Ford. In the episode \"Guilt\", Evans played the son of a small-town sheriff who tries to exact revenge after Dr. Richard Kimble - incognito as a liquor store owner - refuses to sell him and his friends alcohol. After small roles in Medo em Cherry Falls (2000) and The Newcomers (2000) - two unknown low-budget features - Evans appeared in Boston Public (2000) (Fox, 2000-2004) as a murder suspect. He then appeared in his first major feature, N\u00e3o \u00e9 Mais um Besteirol Americano (2001), a spoof on teen comedies wherein he played a jock who makes a bet that he can turn an unpopular and unkempt girl (Chyler Leigh) into prom queen.After filming a couple of television pilots he was confident would be successful - Rec\u00e9m-Casados (2003) and Eastwick (2002) - he appeared in another listless teen comedy, Nota M\u00e1xima (2004), playing an average, ho-hum student who takes part in a plot to steal the SAT test. Hijinks naturally ensue. Then, Evans broke through to the Big Time, grabbing the lead in the kidnapping thriller, Celular: Um Grito de Socorro (2004), a suspenseful B movie with a cheesy gimmick - a random wrong number on his cell phone forces him into a high-stakes race to save an unknown woman's life. Despite an unassuming performance from Evans and Kim Basinger as the damsel in distress, Celular: Um Grito de Socorro (2004) failed to break any box office records or please a wide majority of critics. Evans then prepared himself for super stardom when he signed on to play Johnny Storm in Quarteto Fant\u00e1stico (2005), 20th Century Fox's long-awaited adaptation of the Marvel comic. Although the film was wildly uneven and disappointing, Evans nearly stole the show with his energetic, unfettered performance. In that year itself, Chris was noticed by critics and made it into magazine and Internet countdowns, scoring himself a third position of the hot body countdown from Gay.com and #18 on E! Television's 2006 101 Sexiest Celebrity Bodies.The year 2007 also proved to be one successful year for Chris, as he had two movies released around the world that same year, starting with the second installment of the Marvel franchise Fantastic Four. Chris received positive reviews for his performance. O Di\u00e1rio de uma Bab\u00e1 (2007), where Evans played Harvard Hottie, showed his sensitive. The year 2008 saw Chris Evans' part of the movie Os Reis da Rua (2008), playing the character Detective Paul Diskant. The movie is about police officers trying to cover up their wrongdoings and audiences got to see a serious side of Chris. In the same year, Chris also worked on the movie Tesouro Perdido (2008).\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Bryson Atud and Anastasia Andrew Veno\n          \n\n", "realName": "Christopher Robert Evans", "height": "183"},

His father's ancestry is Italian, and his mother is of half French-Canadian and half Italian descent. Mark moved with his family to Virginia Beach, Virginia, where he lived out most of his teenage years. Following high school, Mark moved with his family to San Diego and soon migrated north, eventually settling in Los Angeles. He took classes at the Stella Adler Conservatory and subsequently co-founded the Orpheus Theatre Company, an Equity-Waiver establishment, where he worked in nearly every capacity. From acting, writing, directing and producing to running the lights and building sets while building his resume. Bartending for nearly nine years to make ends meet and ready to give it all up, a chance meeting and resulting collaboration with playwright/screenwriter Kenneth Lonergan changed everything.Ruffalo won NY success in Lonergan's play \"This Is Our Youth\", which led to the male lead in Lonergan's film Conte Comigo (2000), playing the ne'er-do-well brother of Laura Linney. The performance drew rave reviews and invited comparisons to an early Marlon Brando. Notable roles in A \u00daltima Fortaleza (2001), XX/XY (2002), and C\u00f3digos de Guerra (2002) followed, although in 2002 Ruffalo was diagnosed with an acoustic neuroma, a type of brain tumor. Though the tumor was benign, the resulting surgery led to a period of partial facial paralysis, from which he fully recovered. In 2003, Ruffalo scored leading roles alongside two popular female stars, playing a police detective opposite Meg Ryan in Em Carne Viva (2003) and the love interest of Gwyneth Paltrow in the comedy Voando Alto (2003). Though both films were high-profile box office disappointments, Ruffalo went on to four notable (if highly disparate) films in 2004 - Tenta\u00e7\u00e3o (2004), Brilho Eterno de uma Mente sem Lembran\u00e7as (2004), De Repente 30 (2004), and Colateral (2004) - which solidified his ability to be both a popular leading man and an acclaimed ensemble player in either comedy or drama.After 2004, Ruffalo was consistently at work, with leads in popular Hollywood films and independent productions that continued to solidify him as one of film's most consistently strong actors: E se Fosse Verdade (2005), A Grande Ilus\u00e3o (2006), Zod\u00edaco (2007), Tra\u00eddos pelo Destino (2007), and Vigaristas (2008). In 2010 Ruffalo achieved something of a breakthrough, by directing the indie film O Enviado (2010), which won him the Special Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival, and co-starring as the sperm-donor father to lesbian couple Annette Bening and Julianne Moore in Minhas M\u00e3es e Meu Pai (2010). His role in the idiosyncratic domestic comedy/drama earned him Academy Award, Independent Spirit Award, Screen Actors Guild, and BAFTA nominations for Best Supporting Actor.High-profile roles in Martin Scorsese's Ilha do Medo (2010) and 'Kenneth Longeran''s long-delayed Margaret (2011) followed before Ruffalo's appearance as Dr. Bruce Banner, aka The Hulk, in Joss Whedon's blockbuster The Avengers: Os Vingadores (2012). Garnering highly positive reviews for a role in which actors Eric Bana and Edward Norton could not find success in previous films made Ruffalo a box office star in addition to a critically-acclaimed actor. He is expected to reprise the role in the upcoming 2015 sequel, and reunited with former co-star Gywneth Paltrow in the sex-addiction comedy-drama Terapia do Sexo (2012); Ruffalo also will take the lead in Ryan Murphy's adaptation of Larry Kramer's AIDS-drama play The Normal Heart (2014).Ruffalo has been married to actress Sunrise Coigney since 2000; the couple have three children, a son and two daughters.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Gary Brumburgh / gr-home@pacbell.net\n          \n\n", "realName": "Mark Alan Ruffalo", "height": "173"},

Born in Karlsruhe, Germany, May 31, 1962, he spent his childhood and youth in Stuttgart, southwestern Germany. He planned to become a musician, but in the late seventies a Stuttgart theater production by director Claus Peymann, inspired him to change his professional direction and choose a career as an actor. He graduated in 1985 from the renowned Otto Falckenberg School of Acting in Munich. Initial career performances at Munich&acutes Theater der Jugend were followed by roles including Schiller s \"Die Raeuber\", Goethe s \"Iphigenie\", and \"Dirty Dishes\" from Nick Whitby in engagements at the Staedtischen Buehnen Ulm, the Staatstheater Darmstadt and the Staatlichen Buehnen Berlin. In 1986 he commenced his television career debuting on the side of Commissioner Helmut Fischer in the famous long-running German television Sunday night crime series \"Tatort\"-- \"Die Macht des Schicksals.\" Innumerable crime stories and thrillers followed but it was in 1997 when director Heinrich Breloer cast Koch as Andreas Baader in the highly-acclaimed movie-of-the week two-parter \"Todesspiel\" which overnight changed his career. Five years later in 2002 Sebastian Koch achieved a feat not achieved in over 30 years of German television, he was awarded the coveted Grimme Prize for the leading roles in two television films, \"Der Tanz mit dem Teufel - Die Entfuehrung des Richard Oetker\", the story of the abduction of the heir to the Oetker fortune, as well as for his role in the three-part historical family drama \"The Manns\". The production \"The Manns\" was awarded Germany's esteemed honor as the \"Television Event of the Year 2002\". Koch received additional accolades for his role as Klaus Mann, including the Bavarian Television Prize. His international breakthrough came with the historical mini-series \"Napoleon,\" alongside prominent colleagues including Gerard Depardieu, John Malkovich and Isabella Rossellini, and his role as Cathereine Deneuve's young lover, Rodolphe Loewenstein in \"MARIE AND FREUD\". Koch' s continued choice of roles in his career have provided an extremely intense examination of many personalities and themes pertaining to German history. Beginning theatrically in Constantin Costa-Gavras adaptation of Rolf Hochhuth's \"AMEN\" released in 2002, and then in successive German television events including the 2001 production of \"The Tunnel\", a two-part movie-of-the-week from Roland Suso Richter about the underground tunnel built from west to east Berlin which succeeded in enabling 100 people to flee the GDR; followed in 2003 with director Peter Keglevic's historical drama \"Zwei Tage Hoffnung\" about the infamous strike in the former GDR on June 17, 1953; and, the next year, in \"Operation Valkryrie\", the spectacular docu-drama from Jo Baier, awarded the German Television Prize, about the aristocratic soldier Clemens von Stauffenberg's perfect plot in 1944 to murder Hitler by smuggling a bomb into Hitler's bunker. In 2005 Koch collaborated for the third time with director Heinrich Breloer in \"Speer and Hitler\", the story of Hitler and his architect Albert Speer, garnering Koch both the German Television Prize and Bavarian Television Prize for Best Actor. Sebastian Koch was awarded the Bambi Award for Best Male German Actor 2006. Sebastian Koch is drawn to complex, flawed characters with rough edges. A particular loneliness and/or reclusiveness surrounds Koch's characters, even a certain sadness through which he finds the energy and tension for his roles. In 2006 his stunning performance as GDR dramatist/playwright Georg Dreymann in Florian Henkel von Donnermarck's Oscar-winning theatrical success, the Stasi-drama, \"THE LIVES OF OTHERS\" earned him the 2007 Italian Foreign Press Award, the Globo d'Oro for Best European Actor. In Paul Verhoeven s film \"BLACK BOOK\", which celebrated in 2006 premieres in Venice and Toronto and was nominated from the Netherlands for the 2007 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, Koch played the lead role as a Nazi officer in German-occupied Holland who falls in love with a Jewish Resistance Fighter (Carice van Houten). Under the direction of Hermine Huntgeburth (\"The White Massai\") alongside Julia Jentsch, Koch was most recently shooting EFFIE in the role of Geert von Instetten in the novel adaptation of \"Effi Briest\" by Theodor Fontane. Following the productions in Winter 2007/2008 of \"Gegen den Strom\" (Against the Current) and \"The Interrogation of Harry Wind,\" Koch will travel to Canada for the lead role in the international coproduction of Jack London s classic \"The Sea Wolf.\" The English language TV production, written by Nigel Williams (\"Elizabeth I.\") is being directed by Brit Mike Barker. Koch s German and international theatrical successes include the 2003 remake of Erich Kaestner s children s classic \"DAS FLIEGENDE KLASSENZIMMER\" from director Tomy Wiegand and \"GLOOMY SUNDAY\" from Rolf Schuebel (1999). In Spring 2007 Warner Brothers Germany released the family comedy sequel \"RENNSCHWEIN RUDI RUESSEL 2\" from Peter Timm. Sebastian Koch is alongside his theatrical and television activity a sought after reader for literary and musical audio books and the live performances of these productions. He returned to the theatre stage in 2006 after a long absence, performing the role of Lord Goring in Oscar Wildes \"An Ideal Husband\" under the direction of Armin Holz, a celebrated critical and audience success at the distinguished Schauspielhaus Bochum.Sebastian Koch makes his home in Berlin and has a daughter.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Anke Zindler, www.just-publicity.com\n          \n\n", "realName": null, "height": "182"},

The role of Colonel Hans Landa in Bastardos Ingl\u00f3rios (2009) catapulted Christoph from a lifetime working in German TV/film to the new life of an international superstar and Academy Award-winning actor. He won 27 awards for his performance as Hans Landa, including the Cannes prix d'interpretation Masculin for 2009, the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor, the BAFTA Best Supporting Actor award, and the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor (which he won again for 2012's Django Livre (2012)).He also portrayed computer genius Qohen Leth in the film O Teorema Zero (2013), American plagiarist Walter Keane in the biographical film _Big Eyes (2014), and 007's nemesis and head of SPECTRE Ernst Stavro Blofeld in _Spectre (2015)_. In Quentin Tarantino's 2009 film Inglourious Basterds, Waltz portrayed SS-Standartenf\u00fchrer Hans Landa, aka \"The Jew Hunter\". Clever, courteous, and multilingual - but also self-serving, cunning, implacable, and murderous. Waltz played gangster Benjamin Chudnofsky in O Besouro Verde (2011). That same year, he starred in \u00c1gua para Elefantes (2011), Roman Polanski's Deus da Carnificina (2011), and a remake of Os Tr\u00eas Mosqueteiros (2011). He played German bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz in Quentin Tarantino's Django Livre (2012), a role Tarantino wrote specifically for Waltz.Christoph resides in Berlin and Los Angeles. His wife is costume builder Judith Holste.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            www.ChristophWaltzFans.com and\n          \n\n", "realName": null, "height": "170"},

At the time of her birth, her mother was visiting her grandmother in Fort Worth, though Duvall was raised in Houston. During her childhood, Shelley's mother humorously gave Shelley the nickname \"Manic Mouse\", because she would often run around her house and tip over furniture. Shelley however was more than a mouse, but rather quite the little artist. Her favorite thing to do when she was very young was draw. She also has three brothers: Scott, Shane, and Stewart.Shelley graduated from Waltrip High School in Texas and at first became a cosmetics salesperson. It was in 1970 when Shelley was discovered by talent scouts at a local party. Director Robert Altman wanted to cast Shelley in a film that he was making during the time. Shelley had experience in acting in high school plays at the time and took Altman's offer and she appeared in her first film Brewster McCloud. Altman was so fascinated by her performance that she appeared in his next films including: McCabe and Mrs. Miller in 1971, Thieves Like Us in 1974, and Nashville in 1975. Aside from these three successful films, Duvall's acting blossomed in her leading role as Mille Lammoroux in 3 Women in 1977. Duvall's acting was so superb that she won Best Actress at the 1977 Cannes Film Festival. Shelley also starred as Bernice in Joan Micklin Silver's Bernice Bobs Her Hair in 1976, and had a cameo in Woody Allen's Annie Hall in 1977. In the same year, Shelley also hosted an episode of Saturday Night Live.When the 1980s hit, Duvall's career was just beginning. She is famously known for playing the role of \"Wendy Torrance\" in Stanley Kubrick's The Shining with Jack Nicholson. During the making of this film, Kubrick and Duvall would often become very frustrated with each other. The most obvious example is when Kubrick shot the famous \"baseball bat scene\" with Duvall and Nicholson 127 times, which is the world record for most number of takes in any film set. Despite their differences, Duvall admitted that she learned more from Kubrick than any of her previous films and that she \"wouldn't trade the experience for anything.\" Kubrick also knew that he pushed Shelley and treated her the way he did for a significant reason, as the role of \"Wendy Torrance\" was even said by Jack Nicholson, \"the hardest role anyone has ever had to play.\"In January of 1979, Robert Altman would offer Duvall yet another role in one of his films. Only the role was a certain role that Altman believed she was born to play. That certain role was \"Olive Oyl\" in the real life version of Popeye. Shelley was skeptical at first on accepting the role, due to bad memories as a child of negatively being called \"Olive Oyl\" in grade school. She fortunately decided to take the role and performed admirably. Shelley also sings several songs in this film. The most famous ones would be \"He's Large\" and \"He Needs Me\" which also appeared in the film Punch Drunk Love.As the 1980s rolled on, Shelley's career never slowed down. She appeared as a supporting actress in Terry Gilliam's Time Bandits in 1981; she played \"Susan Frankenstein\" in Tim Burton's Frankenweenie (1984) , and co-starred in the hit comedy film Roxanne in 1987 starring Steve Martin. From 1982 to 1986, Shelley continued her filming career but from a different aspect. Since Shelley was 17, she had a collection of a variety of illustrated classic fairy tale books. During the making of Popeye, she showed her collection to Robin Williams. One particular fairy tale she showed Robin was \"The Frog Prince\". Picturing Robin as the real life Frog Prince, Shelley created Platypus Productions, her own production company. Shelley went to Showtime with the idea for airing a television program that was based on fairy tales. She produced Fairy Tale Theater which Showtime aired that was a hit television series that was based on several classic fairy tales. Fairy Tale Theatre was on television from 1982-1987. Each episode was a one-hour series and there were a total of twenty six episodes, all hosted by Shelley Duvall. Shelley also starred in four out of the twenty six episodes. In 1985, Ms. Duvall created Tall Tales and Legends that was aired for three years until it ended in 1988. Similar to Fairy Tale Theatre, Tall Tales and Legends was also a one-hour series hosted, produced, and guest starred by Duvall. Although it only consisted of nine episodes, Shelley was nominated for an Emmy from the series. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Shelley discovered Think Entertainment; another production company which helped Shelley create more programs and movies that were made for television that aired on common cable channels. Shelley produced three more programs from these production companies that aired on Showtime: Nightmare Classics, Shelley Duvall's Bedtime Stories, and Mrs. Piggle Wiggle. Her Bedtime Stories program earned her a 2nd Emmy Nomination. Shelley sold Think Entertainment in 1993 and retired as a producer.Shelley Duvall's later career found her a number of different roles. She appeared in the family comedy Home Fries in 1998 playing \"Mrs. Jackson\", Drew Barrymore's character's mother. Other comedic films Shelley appeared in were Suburban Commando in 1991, and Changing Habits in 1997. She also had cameos in several TV series' such as: Frasier, L.A. Law, The Ray Bradbury Theater, Wishbone, and several others. Shelley returned to the horror genre when she played \"Martha Stewart\" in The 4th Floor in 1999 and played the role of \"Mrs. Stein\" in Big Monster On Campus in 2000; which consisted of both the comedy and horror genre.Since 2002, Shelley Duvall has not acted in any films, but lives a quiet and peaceful life in Blanco, Texas. She has lived in Blanco since 1994, after her home in Los Angeles got damaged by an earthquake. For the last couple years, there have been several rumors about Duvall being a \"recluse\" and not being in touch with reality. However, a recent interview in 2010 was conducted by MondoFilm VideoGuide that had heavy proof that Shelley is as normal and aware of reality as ever. She has also noted in this interview that she takes care of several animals at her home in Texas and writes a lot of poetry, and that returning to acting is always a possibility.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Matt Zavislak\n          \n\n", "realName": "Shelley Alexis Duvall", "height": "173"},

His family were Jewish immigrants (from Austria, Romania, and Russia). Stanley was considered intelligent, despite poor grades at school. Hoping that a change of scenery would produce better academic performance, Kubrick's father sent him in 1940 to Pasadena, California, to stay with his uncle, Martin Perveler. Returning to the Bronx in 1941 for his last year of grammar school, there seemed to be little change in his attitude or his results. Hoping to find something to interest his son, Jack introduced Stanley to chess, with the desired result. Kubrick took to the game passionately, and quickly became a skilled player. Chess would become an important device for Kubrick in later years, often as a tool for dealing with recalcitrant actors, but also as an artistic motif in his films.Jack Kubrick's decision to give his son a camera for his thirteenth birthday would be an even wiser move: Kubrick became an avid photographer, and would often make trips around New York taking photographs which he would develop in a friend's darkroom. After selling an unsolicited photograph to Look Magazine, Kubrick began to associate with their staff photographers, and at the age of seventeen was offered a job as an apprentice photographer.In the next few years, Kubrick had regular assignments for \"Look\", and would become a voracious movie-goer. Together with friend Alexander Singer, Kubrick planned a move into film, and in 1950 sank his savings into making the documentary O Dia da Luta (1951). This was followed by several short commissioned documentaries (O Padre Voador (1951), and (The Seafarers (1953), but by attracting investors and hustling chess games in Central Park, Kubrick was able to make Medo E Desejo (1953) in California.Filming this movie was not a happy experience; Kubrick's marriage to high school sweetheart Toba Metz did not survive the shooting. Despite mixed reviews for the film itself, Kubrick received good notices for his obvious directorial talents. Kubrick's next two films A Morte Passou por Perto (1955) and O Grande Golpe (1956) brought him to the attention of Hollywood, and in 1957 he directed Kirk Douglas in Gl\u00f3ria Feita de Sangue (1957). Douglas later called upon Kubrick to take over the production of Spartacus (1960), by some accounts hoping that Kubrick would be daunted by the scale of the project and would thus be accommodating. This was not the case, however: Kubrick took charge of the project, imposing his ideas and standards on the film. Many crew members were upset by his style: cinematographer Russell Metty complained to producers that Kubrick was taking over his job. Kubrick's response was to tell him to sit there and do nothing. Metty complied, and ironically was awarded the Academy Award for his cinematography.Kubrick's next project was to direct Marlon Brando in A Face Oculta (1961), but negotiations broke down and Brando himself ended up directing the film himself. Disenchanted with Hollywood and after another failed marriage, Kubrick moved permanently to England, from where he would make all of his subsequent films. Despite having obtained a pilot's license, Kubrick was rumored to be afraid of flying.Kubrick's first UK film was Lolita (1962), which was carefully constructed and guided so as to not offend the censorship boards which at the time had the power to severely damage the commercial success of a film. Dr. Fant\u00e1stico (1964) was a big risk for Kubrick; before this, \"nuclear\" was not considered a subject for comedy. Originally written as a drama, Kubrick decided that too many of the ideas he had written were just too funny to be taken seriously. The film's critical and commercial success allowed Kubrick the financial and artistic freedom to work on any project he desired. Around this time, Kubrick's focus diversified and he would always have several projects in various stages of development: \"Blue Moon\" (a story about Hollywood's first pornographic feature film), \"Napoleon\" (an epic historical biography, abandoned after studio losses on similar projects), \"Wartime Lies\" (based on the novel by Louis Begley), and \"Rhapsody\" (a psycho-sexual thriller).The next film he completed was a collaboration with sci-fi author Arthur C. Clarke. 2001: Uma Odiss\u00e9ia no Espa\u00e7o (1968) is hailed by many as the best ever made; an instant cult favorite, it has set the standard and tone for many science fiction films that followed. Kubrick followed this with Laranja Mec\u00e2nica (1971), which rivaled Lolita (1962) for the controversy it generated - this time not only for its portrayal of sex, but also of violence. Barry Lyndon (1975) would prove a turning point in both his professional and private lives. His unrelenting demands of commitment and perfection of cast and crew had by now become legendary. Actors would be required to perform dozens of takes with no breaks. Filming a story in Ireland involving military, Kubrick received reports that the IRA had declared him a possible target. Production was promptly moved out of the country, and Kubrick's desire for privacy and security resulted in him being considered a recluse ever since.Having turned down directing a sequel to O Exorcista (1973), Kubrick made his own horror film: O Iluminado (1980). Again, rumors circulated of demands made upon actors and crew. Stephen King (whose novel the film was based upon) reportedly didn't like Kubrick's adaptation (indeed, he would later write his own screenplay which was filmed as O Iluminado (1997).)Kubrick's subsequent work has been well spaced: it was seven years before Nascido para Matar (1987) was released. By this time, Kubrick was married with children and had extensively remodeled his house. Seen by one critic as the dark side to the humanist story of Platoon (1986), Nascido para Matar (1987) continued Kubrick's legacy of solid critical acclaim, and profit at the box office.In the 1990s, Kubrick began an on-again/off-again collaboration with Brian Aldiss on a new science fiction film called \"Artificial Intelligence (AI)\", but progress was very slow, and was backgrounded until special effects technology was up to the standard the Kubrick wanted.Kubrick returned to his in-development projects, but encountered a number of problems: \"Napoleon\" was completely dead, and \"Wartime Lies\" (now called \"The Aryan Papers\") was abandoned when Steven Spielberg announced he would direct A Lista de Schindler (1993), which covered much of the same material.While pre-production work on \"AI\" crawled along, Kubrick combined \"Rhapsody\" and \"Blue Movie\" and officially announced his next project as De Olhos Bem Fechados (1999), starring the then-married Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. After two years of production under unprecedented security and privacy, the film was released to a typically polarized critical and public reception; Kubrick claimed it was his best film to date.Special effects technology had matured rapidly in the meantime, and Kubrick immediately began active work on A.I.: Intelig\u00eancia Artificial (2001), but tragically suffered a fatal heart attack in his sleep on March 7th, 1999.After Kubrick's death, Spielberg revealed that the two of them were friends that frequently communicated discreetly about the art of filmmaking; both had a large degree of mutual respect for each other's work. \"AI\" was frequently discussed; Kubrick even suggested that Spielberg should direct it as it was more his type of project. Based on this relationship, Spielberg took over as the film's director and completed the last Kubrick project.How much of Kubrick's vision remains in the finished project -- and what he would think of the film as eventually released -- will be the final great unanswerable mysteries in the life of this talented and private filmmaker.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Murray Chapman <muzzle@imdb.com>\n          \n\n", "realName": null, "height": "169"},

His parents, Bryna (Sanglel) and Herschel Danielovitch, were Jewish immigrants from Chavusy, Mahilyow Voblast (now in Belarus). Although growing up in a poor ghetto, Douglas was a fine student and a keen athlete and wrestled competitively during his time at St. Lawrence University. However, he soon identified an acting scholarship as a way out of his meager existence, and was sufficiently talented to gain entry into the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. He only appeared in a handful of minor Broadway productions before joining the United States Navy in 1941, and then after the end of hostilities in 1945, returned to the theater and some radio work. On the insistence of ex-classmate Lauren Bacall, movie producer Hal B. Wallis screen-tested Douglas and cast him in the lead role in O Tempo N\u00e3o Apaga (1946). His performance received rave reviews and further work quickly followed, including an appearance in the low-key drama Estranha Fascina\u00e7\u00e3o (1947), the first time he worked alongside fellow future screen legend Burt Lancaster. Such was the strong chemistry between the two that they appeared in seven films together, including the dynamic western Sem Lei e Sem Alma (1957), the John Frankenheimer political thriller Sete Dias de Maio (1964) and their final pairing in the gangster comedy Os \u00daltimos Dur\u00f5es (1986). Douglas once said about his good friend: \"I've finally gotten away from Burt Lancaster. My luck has changed for the better. I've got nice-looking girls in my films now.\".After appearing in \"I Walk Alone\", Douglas scored his first Oscar nomination playing the untrustworthy and opportunistic boxer Midge Kelly in the gripping O Invenc\u00edvel (1949). The quality of his work continued to garner the attention of critics and he was again nominated for Oscars for his role as a film producer in Assim Estava Escrito (1952) and as tortured painter Vincent van Gogh in Sede de Viver (1956), both directed by Vincente Minnelli. In 1955, Douglas launched his own production company, Bryna Productions, the company behind two pivotal film roles in his career. The first was as French army officer Col. Dax in director Stanley Kubrick's brilliant anti-war epic Gl\u00f3ria Feita de Sangue (1957). Douglas reunited with Kubrick for yet another epic, the magnificent Spartacus (1960). The film also marked a key turning point in the life of screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, who had been blacklisted during the McCarthy \"Red Scare\" hysteria in the 1950s. At Douglas' insistence, Trumbo was given on-screen credit for his contributions, which began the dissolution of the infamous blacklisting policies begun almost a decade previously that had destroyed so many careers and lives.Douglas remained busy throughout the 1960s, starring in many films. He played a rebellious modern-day cowboy in Sua \u00daltima Fa\u00e7anha (1962), acted alongside John Wayne in the World War II story A Primeira Vit\u00f3ria (1965), again with The Duke in a drama about the Israeli fight for independence, \u00c0 Sombra de um Gigante (1966), and once more with Wayne in the tongue-in-cheek western Gigantes em Luta (1967). Additionally in 1963, he starred in an onstage production of Ken Kesey's \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\", but despite his keen interest, no Hollywood studio could be convinced to bring the story to the screen. However, the rights remained with the Douglas clan, and Kirk's talented son Michael Douglas finally filmed the tale in 1975, starring Jack Nicholson. Into the 1970s, Douglas wasn't as busy as previous years; however, he starred in some unusual vehicles, including alongside a young Arnold Schwarzenegger in the loopy western comedy Cactus Jack, o Vil\u00e3o (1979), then with Farrah Fawcett in the sci-fi thriller Saturno 3 (1980) and then he traveled to Australia for the horse opera/drama Heran\u00e7a de um Valente (1982).Unknown to many, Kirk has long been involved in humanitarian causes and has been a Goodwill Ambassador for the US State Department since 1963. His efforts were rewarded with the Presidential Medal of Freedom (1981), and with the Jefferson Award (1983). Furthermore, the French honored him with the Chevalier of the Legion of Honor. More recognition followed for his work with the American Cinema Award (1987), the German Golden Kamera Award (1987), The National Board of Reviews Career Achievement Award (1989), an honorary Academy Award (1995), Recipient of the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award (1999) and the UCLA Medal of Honor (2002). Despite a helicopter crash and a stroke suffered in the 1990s, he remains active and continues to appear in front of the camera.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            firehouse44\n          \n\n", "realName": "Issur Danielovitch", "height": "175"},

He graduated as a music major because his dean had discouraged him from pursuing a theatrical career. Ignoring that advice, Meeker nevertheless moved to New York to study method acting and performing in local stock companies. After being injured during a brief wartime stint with the navy and consequently discharged from active duty, Meeker went overseas to play his part in entertaining the troops as a member of the USO. He finally 'arrived' on Broadway in 1945 and was given small roles in two plays produced by Jos\u00e9 Ferrer, making his stage debut in \"Strange Fruit\". He was still relatively unknown in 1947 when he replaced Marlon Brando as Stanley Kowalski in \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" two years later, in the process giving a commanding and critically acclaimed performance. After playing Kowalski in the touring company of 'Streetcar', Meeker was again critically acclaimed for his part in the original production of \"Mister Roberts\" . As a result, he had several European motion picture offers and selected to play the role of an army sergeant in Teresa (1951), co-starring Pier Angeli. That same year, he was in another continental drama shot on location in Switzerland, entitled 4 Num Jeep (1951). After a two-year sojourn at MGM Meeker returned to Broadway to star as the swaggering, likeable, larger-than-life rogue Hal Carter in William Inge's play \"Picnic\" on Broadway. His performance was not only highly praised by reviewers like Brooks Atkinson but also won him the New York Critics Circle Award. In later years, Meeker claimed to have spurned Columbia's offer of reprising his role on screen because he disdained being shackled by a studio contract. In any case, the prize role went to William Holden and Meeker ended up being consigned for the next thirty years to provide support (with the odd exception) as hard- nosed guys on either side of the law (or bullies with a yellow streak). He did, nonetheless, leave his mark with several top-notch performances.One of his best early screen roles was that of the disgraced ex-Union officer Roy Anderson in Anthony Mann's brilliant revenge western O Pre\u00e7o de um Homem (1953). As one of four men stripped of humanity by greed and hatred (the others were James Stewart, Robert Ryan and Millard Mitchell), Ralph Meeker gave a convincing portrayal of a cynical and callous opportunist.Meeker's defining role was that of Mike Hammer in A Morte num Beijo (1955). The film was unusual in that Hammer was played -- unlike the gumshoes of previous films noir -- as a basically unsavoury character. His was one of the first anti-heroes who began to appear in films of the 1960s. Under the direction of Robert Aldrich, Meeker's characterisation as Mike Hammer effectively contrasted a smooth, handsome facade with an undercurrent of arrogance, unmitigated ruthlessness and greed. When the film was released, it ran into censorship trouble, the Kefauver Commission labelling it the Number One Menace to American Youth for 1955. While \"Kiss Me Deadly\" acquired a cult following over the years, it certainly failed to advance the career of Ralph Meeker.He did, however, manage to get second billing for the part of Corporal Paris, one of three World War I French infantry men randomly selected for execution (because their regiment had refused a suicidal mission) in Stanley Kubrick's harrowing anti-war drama Gl\u00f3ria Feita de Sangue (1957). He gave another finely etched performance through his character's gradual deterioration from swaggering bravado to abject fear. Also that year, Meeker played a snarling, Indian-hating Yankee officer in Renegando o Meu Sangue (1957) and co-starred as Jane Russells unlikely kidnapper in the failed Norman Taurog comedy De Camisola Cor-de-Rosa (1957).In between numerous television appearances during the 60s, Meeker returned to the stage as member of the Lincoln Centre Repertory Theatre where he was reunited with Elia Kazan (who had directed him in 'Streetcar') to act in Arthur Miller's play \"After the Fall\" (1964-65). He also worked with Robert Aldrich again in \"The Dirty Dozen\" and that same year with Roger Corman playing George 'Bugs' Moran (who Meeker allegedly resembled), the Chicago mobster whose gang was famously 'rubbed out' by Al Capone. in O Massacre de Chicago (1967).After the decline of the studio system, Meeker found much gainful employment in television and even had his own syndicated series, Not for Hire (1959), playing a tough Honolulu investigator.

The epitome of knavish, continental charm and sartorial opulence, Menjou, complete with trademark waxy black mustache, evolved into one of Hollywood's most distinguished of artists and fashion plates, a tailor-made scene-stealer, if you will. What is often forgotten is that he was primed as a matin\u00e9e idol back in the silent-film days. With hooded, slightly owlish eyes, a prominent nose and prematurely receding hairline, he was hardly competition for Rudolph Valentino, but he did possess the requisite demeanor to confidently pull off a roguish and magnetic man-about-town. Fluent in six languages, Menjou was nearly unrecognizable without some type of formal wear, and he went on to earn distinction as the nation's \"best dressed man\" nine times.Born on February 18, 1890, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, he was christened Adolphe Jean Menjou, the elder son of a hotel manager. His Irish mother was a distant cousin of novelist / poet James Joyce (\"Ulysses\") (1882-1941). His French father, an \u00e9migr\u00e9, eventually moved the family to Cleveland, where he operated a chain of restaurants. He disapproved of show business and sent an already piqued Adolphe to Culver Military Academy in Indiana in the hopes of dissuading him from such a seemingly reckless and disreputable career. From there Adolphe was enrolled at Stiles University prep school and then Cornell University. Instead of acquiescing to his father's demands and obtaining a engineering degree, however, he abruptly changed his major to liberal arts and began auditioning for college plays. He left Cornell in his third year in order to help his father manage a restaurant for a time during a family financial crisis. From there he left for New York and a life in the theater.Adolphe toiled as a laborer, a haberdasher and even a waiter in one of his father's restaurants during his salad days, which included some vaudeville work. Oddly enough, he never made it to Broadway but instead found extra and/or bit work for various film studios (Vitagraph, Edison, Biograph) starting in 1915. World War I interrupted his early career, and he served as a captain with the Ambulance Corps in France. After the war he found employment off-camera as a productions manager and unit manager. When the New York-based film industry moved west, so did Adolphe.Nothing of major significance happened for the fledgling actor until 1921, an absolute banner year for him. After six years of struggle he finally broke into the top ranks with substantial roles in The Faith Healer (1921) and M\u00e3es Fr\u00edvolas (1921), the latter starring Mary Pickford. He formed some very strong connections as a result and earned a Paramount contract in the process. Cast by Mary's then-husband Douglas Fairbanks as Louis XIII in the rousing silent Os Tr\u00eas Mosqueteiros (1921), he finished off the year portraying the influential writer/friend Raoul de Saint Hubert in Rudolph Valentino's classic Paix\u00e3o de B\u00e1rbaro (1921).Firmly entrenched in the Hollywood lifestyle, it took little time for Menjou to establish his slick prototype as the urbane ladies' man and wealthy rou\u00e9. Paramount, noticing how Menjou stole scenes from Charles Chaplin favorite Edna Purviance in Chaplin's Casamento ou Luxo (1923), started capitalizing on Menjou's playboy image by casting him as various callous and creaseless matin\u00e9e leads in such films as Broadway After Dark (1924), Sinners in Silk (1924), O Querido de Todas (1926), Desfrutando a Alta Sociedade (1926) and Um Gentleman de Paris (1927). His younger brother Henri Menjou, a minor actor, had a part in Adolphe's picture Loura ou Morena? (1927).The stock market crash led to the termination of Adolphe's Paramount contract, and his status as leading man ended with it. MGM took him on at half his Paramount salary and his fluency in such languages as French and Spanish kept him employed at the beginning. Rivaling Gary Cooper for the attentions of Marlene Dietrich in Marrocos (1930) started the ball rolling for Menjou as a dressy second lead. Rarely placed in leads following this period, he managed his one and only Oscar nomination for \"Best Actor\" with his performance as editor Walter Burns in A Primeira P\u00e1gina (1931). Not initially cast in the role, he replaced Louis Wolheim, who died ten days into rehearsal. Quality parts in quality pictures became the norm for Adolphe during the 1930s, with outstanding roles given him in O Eterno D. Juan (1931), Adeus \u00e0s Armas (1932), A Mulher Proibida (1932), Dada em Penhor (1934), Manh\u00e3 de Gl\u00f3ria (1933), Nasce uma Estrela (1937), No Teatro da Vida (1937) and Conflito de Duas Almas (1939).The 1940s were not as golden, however. In addition to entertaining the troops overseas and making assorted broadcasts in a host of different languages, he did manage to get the slick and slimy Billy Flynn lawyer role opposite Ginger Rogers' felon in the \"Chicago\" adaptation Pernas Provocantes (1942), and continued to earn occasional distinction in such post-WWII pictures as Mercador de Ilus\u00f5es (1947) and Sua Esposa e o Mundo (1948). His last lead was in the crackerjack thriller Vol\u00fapia de Matar (1952), in which he played an (urbane) San Francisco homicide detective tracking down a killer who preys on women in San Francisco, and he appeared without his mustache for the first time in nearly two decades. Also active on radio and TV, his last notable film was the classic anti-war picture Gl\u00f3ria Feita de Sangue (1957) playing the villainous Gen. Broulard.Adolphe's extreme hardcore right-wing Republican politics hurt his later reputation, as he was made a scapegoat for his cooperation as a \"friendly witness\" at the House Un-American Activities Commission hearing during the Joseph McCarthy Red Scare era. Following his last picture, Disney's Pollyanna (1960), in which he played an uncharacteristically rumpled curmudgeon who is charmed by Hayley Mills, he retired from acting. He died after a nine-month battle with hepatitis on October 29, 1963, inside his Beverly Hills home. Three times proved the charm for Adolphe with his 1934 marriage to actress Verree Teasdale, who survived him. The couple had an adopted son named Peter. His autobiography, \"It Took Nine Tailors\" (1947), pretty much says it all for this polished, preening professional.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Gary Brumburgh / gr-home@pacbell.net\n          \n\n", "realName": "Adolphe Jean Menjou", "height": "179"},

He attended and graduated from Brown University and had a short stint as a New York newspaperman, but became interested in acting on the advice of colorful Polish \u00e9migr\u00e9 classical stage director Richard Boleslawski, who would go on to Hollywood to direct some notable and important films, including Rasputin e a Imperatriz (1932)--the only film in which siblings John Barrymore, Ethel Barrymore and Lionel Barrymore appeared together--and A Conquista de um Imp\u00e9rio (1935) with Ronald Colman. Perhaps acting was meant for Macready all along--he claimed that he was descended from 19th-century Shakespearean actor William Macready.In 1926 Macready made his Broadway debut in \"The Scarlet Letter\". His Broadway career would extend to 1958, entailing 15 plays--mainly dramas but also some comedies--with the lion's share of roles in the 1930s. His Shakespearean run included the lead as Benedick in \"Much Ado About Nothing\" (1927), \"Macbeth\" (1928) and \"Romeo and Juliet\" (1934), with Broadway legend Katharine Cornell. He co-starred with her again in \"The Barretts of Wimpole Street\" and with with Helen Hayes in \"Victoria Regina\" twice (1936 and 1937).Macready's aquiline features coupled with distinctive high-brow bottom-voiced diction and superior, nose-in-the-air delivery that could be quickly tinged with a gothic menace made him perfect as the cultured bad guy. Added to his demeanor was a significant curved scar on his right cheek, remnant of a car accident in about 1919--better PR that it was a saber slash wound from his dueling days as a youth. He did not turn to films until 1942 and did not weigh-in fully committed until 1944, with a host of both well-crafted and just fair movies until the end of World War II. When he went all in, though, he excelled as strong-willed authoritarian and ambitious, murderous--but well-bred--villains. Among his better roles in that period were in A S\u00e9tima Cruz (1944), O Aviso de Morte (1944), Alma Russa (1945) and Tr\u00e1gico \u00c1libi (1945) with a young Nina Foch. Averaging six or more films per year throughout the 1940s, he appeared not only in dramas and thrillers, but also period pieces and even some westerns. His standout role, however--and probably the one he is best remembered for--was the silver-haired, dark-suited and mysteriously rich Ballin Mundson in Gilda (1946), who malevolently inserted himself into the lives of smoldering Rita Hayworth and moody Glenn Ford.By the early 1950s he had sampled the waters of early TV. He had many appearances on such anthology series as Four Star Playhouse (1952), The Ford Television Theatre (1952) and Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1955), among others. He became a familiar presence in episodic TV series beginning in 1954. He made the rounds of most of the hit shows of the period, including a slew of westerns, including such obscure series as The Texan (1958) and The Rough Riders (1958). He was familiar to viewers of crime dramas--such as Perry Mason (1957)--and such classic sci-fi and horror series as Thriller (1960), Quinta Dimens\u00e3o (1963) and Galeria do Terror (1969). He did some 200 TV roles altogether, but still continued his film appearances. He assayed what many consider his best role as the ambitious French Gen. Paul Mireau, a fanatic and martinet whose lust for fame and glory leads to the deaths of hundreds of French soldiers in a senseless frontal attack on heavily fortified German lines in Stanley Kubrick classic antiwar film Gl\u00f3ria Feita de Sangue (1957). Macready's performance stood out in a film brimming with standout performances, from such veterans as Kirk Douglas, Adolphe Menjou, Ralph Meeker and Timothy Carey. The film was even more striking when it turns out that it was based on a true incident.Macready stayed busy into the 1960s, mainly in TV roles. He had a three-year run as Martin Peyton in the hit series A Caldeira do Diabo (1964), the first prime-time soap opera and a launching pad for many a young rising star of the time. His film roles became fewer, but there were some good ones--the Yul Brynner adventure period piece Taras Bulba (1962) and a meaty role as an advisor to US Prlesident Fredric March attempting to stop a coup by a right-wing general played by Burt Lancaster in the gripping Sete Dias de Maio (1964). His next-to-last film appearance was as a very human Cordell Hull, Secretary of State, in Universal's splashy, big-budget but somewhat uneven story of Pearl Harbor, Tora! Tora! Tora! (1970).Another role that stands out in his career is a one-in-a-kind film which you would not expect to find George Macready--Blake Edwards' uproarious comedy -The Great Race (1965)_. Macready shined in one of the film's several subplots, this one a spoof of the \"Ruritanian\" chestnut \"The P Prizoner of Zenda\", in which the racers find themselves in the middle of palace intrigue in a small European monarchy. Macready played a general trying to stave off a coup by using Professor Fate (Jack Lemmon, who is a double for the drunken ruler. Macready held his own with such comedy veterans as Lemmon, Tony Curtis, Natalie Wood and a host of others. To top it of, Macready gets involved in one of the great pie fights in film history, and takes one right in the kisser!In real life George Macready was as cultured as he appeared to be on-screen. He was a well-regarded connoisseur of art, and he and a fellow art devotee--and longtime friend--opened a very successful Los Angeles art gallery together during World War II. As far as the villain roles went, Macready was grateful for the depth they allowed him through his years as both film and television actor. \"I like heavies,\" he once said, and to that he added with a philosophic twinkle, \"I think there's a little bit of evil in all of us.\"\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            William McPeak (qv's & corrections by A.

He is the son of Georgann (Gaither) and Thomas Henry Crudup III, and the grandson of prominent attorney William Cotter \"Billy\" Gaither, Jr.Crudup was raised in Florida and Texas. His family frequently moved and always being the new kid meant Billy had to develop some way of gaining acceptance. Being the class clown was his ticket in. He found roles in school pageants and developed funny impersonations to entertain family and friends. He received his undergraduate degree from the University of North Carolina (where he confirmed his interest in acting). Upon graduation, Crudup headed to NYC to live with his brother Tommy (who was at that time a publicist) and study at New York University, where he joined a theatre troupe called \"the lab!\" and did little plays and musicals - he even played \"Schroeder\" in the famed children's musical \"You're A Good Man Charlie Brown!\".He then went on to earn a Master of Fine Arts from the Tisch School of the Arts at NY in 1994. A year later, he'd already made a name for himself on Broadway, earning the Outer Critics Circle Outstanding Newcomer Award for his performance in Tom Stoppard's \"Arcadia\".Crudup's first big-screen acting gig was in the indie film Grind - Correndo Contra a Vida (1997), which was shot in 1994, but ended up on the shelf for three years. In 1996, he landed another, more lucrative role, opposite Hollywood hotshots Brad Pitt and Jason Patric in the Barry Levinson drama, Sleepers: A Vingan\u00e7a Adormecida (1996). He followed that up with a brief appearance in Woody Allen's Todos Dizem Eu Te Amo (1996) and a higher-profile turn as the rakish older brother in C\u00edrculo de Paix\u00f5es (1997).A self-described student of human nature, Crudup has said that he looks for characters wrestling with their mistakes. Rumor has it that he declined an audition for the lead in Titanic (1997) in order to seek out more challenging projects--like the \"Steve Prefontaine\" biopic Prova de Fogo (1998). \"Limits\" showcased Crudup's ability to completely transform himself for a role (a quality that would help him skirt stardom while continuing to land substantive parts). In 2000, with three major films in release, Crudup's already bustling movie career reached a fever pitch. He first hit the festival circuit in Keith Gordon's Amor Maior que a Vida (2000), the tale of an up-and-coming politician who is haunted by the death of his young wife. Next came the art-house favorite O Filho de Jesus (1999). Finally, he starred as the semi-fictional '70s rocker \"Russell Hammond\" in Cameron Crowe's much-lauded Quase Famosos (2000). In 2002, his production of \"The Elephant Man\" on Broadway closed after 65 performances, due to low ticket sales.Crudup lives in New York and returns regularly to the stage - in fact, it was during the 1996 Broadway run of \"Bus Stop\" that he began his romance with longtime girlfriend, Mary-Louise Parker. That romance ended in 2004, when Crudup left the then-pregnant Parker for his A Bela do Palco (2004) co-star, Claire Danes. He seems to prefer quiet anonymity to the pomp and circumstance of the movie star lifestyle, but his ever-growing popularity guarantees that he won't be able to avoid the spotlight altogether.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            IMDb Editors/moviegirl1721 and Jill\n          \n\n", "realName": "William Gaither Crudup", "height": "174"},

From the following year on, she had leading roles in pictures for Keystone, then a year with Triangle, and, in 1919, a contract with Cecil B. DeMille. DeMille transformed her from a typical Mack Sennett comedienne into a lively, provocative, even predatory, star. She collected husbands (e.g., the indigent Henri de la Falaise) and lovers (e.g., Joseph P. Kennedy, father of President John F. Kennedy). Kennedy produced her Minha Rainha (1932), directed by Erich von Stroheim (it was von Stroheim's copy of this film that Swanson was watching as Norma Desmond in Crep\u00fasculo dos Deuses (1950) when she leaped into the projection beam shouting, \"Have they forgotten what a star looks like? I'll be up there again, so help me!\"--ironic in that the butler-projectionist was, again, von Stroheim). She survived the switch to talkies, even learning how to sing for M\u00fasica no Ar (1934), but her kinds of films were over with by that time. She returned to the stage in the 1940s (\"Reflected Glory,\" \"Let us Be Gay,\" \"A Goose for a Gander\"). She was a clothes designer and artist; she founded Essence of Nature Cosmetics; and she made television appearances through the 1960s and 1970s, doing cameos and pushing health foods.

His family was Jewish.After spending some time working in his father's hat factory, he emigrated to America around 1909. Working in various jobs he arrived in Hollywood in 1914 and got work in D.W. Griffiths' company as a bit player. America's entry into WW1 enabled him to play sadistic monocled German officers but these roles dried up when the war ended. He turned to writing and directing but his passion for unnecessary detail such as Austrian guards wearing correct and expensively acquired regulation underwear which was never seen in 'Foolish Wives' caused the budget to reach a reported $1 million. Although the film became a hit the final edit was given to others resulting in a third of his footage being cut. Irving Thalberg fired him from 'Merry Go Round' which was completed by Rupert Julien. He then started on 'Greed', which when completed was unreleasable being 42 reels with a running time of 7 hours. It was eventually cut down to 10 reels which still had a striking effect on audiences. 'The Wedding March' was so long that even in it's unfinished state it was released as two separate films in Europe. Gloria Swanson fired him from her production of 'Queen Kelly' when with no sign of the film nearing completion the costs had risen to twice the budget partly due to him re-shooting scenes that had already been passed by the Hays office. She then had to spend a further $200,000 putting the footage into releasable state. It was the end for him as a director, but he made a reasonable success as an actor in the talkies.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            tonyman5\n          \n\n", "realName": "Erich Oswald Hans Carl Maria Von Stroheim", "height": "168"},

Discovered on stage after transferring to California's UCLA, the pretty, peaches-and-cream blonde was quickly signed by Paramount Studios in 1948 and almost immediately handed co-starring parts after an uncredited bit part in O Retrato de Jennie (1948).After playing in the film Devastando Caminho (1949), Olson went on to win the role of script girl Betty Schaefer, who attracts never-do-well screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden) and irks the reclusive and increasingly deranged former film star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) in the towering classic Crep\u00fasculo dos Deuses (1950). Olson received an Oscar nomination for \"Best Supporting Actress\" for her role. Her pairing with Holden, in fact, went over so well, they were teamed in a succession of standard features: Rastro Sangrento (1950), Quando Passar a Tormenta (1951), and O Tigre dos Mares (1951), none holding a candle to their \"Sunset\" pairing. Other male co-stars during this active period included John Wayne as Uma Aventura Perigosa (1952), Steve Forrest in Meu Filho, Minha Vida (1953) (one of her finer post \"Sunset\" roles), and Will Rogers Jr. in A\u00e7o de Boa T\u00eampera (1954).Her increasing status in Hollywood came to a virtual halt in the mid-1950s, after marrying renowned lyricist Alan Jay Lerner (who later wrote \"On a Clear Day...\" and \"Camelot\"). She abruptly put her acting on hold in favor of raising their two daughters and her career never fully recovered. The couple divorced in 1957 and she decided to return full-time to acting but by the late 1950s she was perceived as too mature to now play the fresh-faced, girl-next-door type for which she was so identified.Disney Studios came to the rescue, however, in the early 1960s and gave her mid-career an added luster by playing Fred MacMurray love interest in both O Fant\u00e1stico Super-Homem (1961) and O Fabuloso Criador de Encrencas (1963). Her poise, charm and ever-animated appeal was absolutely in sync with the studio's squeaky-clean image, and adding just the right amount of feisty, feminine starch for the light slapstick happenings around her. Other Disney films in which she participated included Pollyanna (1960) and Folias na Neve (1972). She also made an uncredited cameo appearance in the Flubber: Uma Inven\u00e7\u00e3o Desmiolada (1997) remake starring Robin Williams.Olson went on to find sunny work on Broadway, notably in the plays \"The Tunnel of Love,\" \"Send Me No Flowers\" and \"Mary, Mary\". In the 1970s and 1980s, she came back with a couple of secondary parts on regular series TV, but the shows were both short-lived. She retired for all intents and purposes in the mid-1980s. Her second marriage in 1962 to record executive Alan Livingston, who also created the TV character of Bozo the Clown, was long lasting (he died in 2009) and their son, Christopher Livingston has three film credits as, variously, director, editor, cinematographer, producer and actor.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Gary Brumburgh / gr-home@pacbell.net\n          \n\n", "realName": null, "height": "168"},

He broke into films as a screenwriter in 1929 and wrote scripts for many German films until Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933. Wilder immediately realized his Jewish ancestry would cause problems, so he emigrated to Paris, then the US. Although he spoke no English when he arrived in Hollywood, Wilder was a fast learner and thanks to contacts such as Peter Lorre (with whom he shared an apartment), he was able to break into American films. His partnership with Charles Brackett started in 1938 and the team was responsible for writing some of Hollywood's classic comedies, including Ninotchka (1939) and Bola de Fogo (1941). The partnership expanded into a producer-director one in 1942, with Brackett producing and the two turned out such classics as Cinco Covas no Egito (1943), Farrapo Humano (1945) (Oscars for Best Picture, Director and Screenplay) and Crep\u00fasculo dos Deuses (1950) (Oscars for Best Screenplay), after which the partnership dissolved. (Wilder had already made one film, Pacto de Sangue (1944) without Brackett, as the latter had refused to work on a film he felt dealt with such disreputable characters.) Wilder's subsequent self-produced films would become more caustic and cynical, notably A Montanha dos 7 Abutres (1951), though he also produced such sublime comedies as Quanto Mais Quente Melhor (1959) and Se Meu Apartamento Falasse (1960) (which won him Best Picture and Director Oscars).

He was the son of Agnes Doreen \"Peg\" (Marks) and William \"Bill\" Sellers. His parents worked in an acting company run by his grandmother. His father was Protestant and his mother was Jewish (of both Ashkenazi and Sephardi background). His parents' first child had died at birth, so Sellers was spoiled during his early years. He enlisted in the Royal Air Force and served during World War II. After the war he met Spike Milligan, Harry Secombe and Michael Bentine, who would become his future workmates.After the war, he set up a review in London, which was a combination of music (he played the drums) and impressions. Then, all of a sudden, he burst into prominence as the voices of numerous favorites on the BBC radio program \"The Goon Show\" (1951-1960), and then making his debut in films in Penny Points to Paradise (1951) and Down Among the Z Men (1952), before making it big as one of the criminals in Quinteto da Morte (1955). These small but showy roles continued throughout the 1950s, but he got his first big break playing the dogmatic union man, Fred Kite, in Papai \u00e9 um Nudista (1959). The film's success led to starring vehicles into the 1960s that showed off his extreme comic ability to its fullest. In 1962, Sellers was cast in the role of Clare Quilty in the Stanley Kubrick version of the film Lolita (1962) in which his performance as a mentally unbalanced TV writer with multiple personalities landed him another part in Kubrick's Dr. Fant\u00e1stico (1964) in which he played three roles which showed off his comic talent in play-acting in three different accents; British, American, and German.The year 1964 represented a peak in his career with four films in release, all of them well-received by critics and the public alike: Dr. Fant\u00e1stico (1964), for which he was Oscar nominated, A Pantera Cor-de-Rosa (1963), in which he played his signature role of the bumbling French Inspector Jacques Clouseau for the first time, its almost accidental sequel, Um Tiro no Escuro (1964), and O Mundo de Henry Orient (1964). Sellers was on top of the world, but on the evening of April 5, 1964, he suffered a nearly fatal heart attack after inhaling several amyl nitrites (also called 'poppers'; an aphrodisiac-halogen combination) while engaged in a sexual act with his second wife Britt Ekland. He has been working on Billy Wilder's Beija-me, Idiota (1964). In a move Wilder later regretted, he replaced Sellers with Billy Wilder rather than hold up production. By October 1964, Sellers made a full recovery and was working again.The mid-1960s were noted for the popularity of all things British, from the Beatles music (who were presented with their Grammy for Best New Artist by Sellers) to the James Bond films, and the world turned to Sellers for comedy. Que \u00e9 que H\u00e1, Gatinha? (1965) was another big hit, but a combination of his ego and insecurity was making Sellers difficult to work with. When the James Bond spoof Casino Royale (1967) ran over budget and was unable to recoup its costs despite an otherwise healthy box-office take, Sellers received some of the blame. He turned down an offer from United Artists for the title role in Inspetor Clouseau (1968), but was angry when the production went ahead with Alan Arkin in his place. His difficult reputation and increasingly erratic behavior, combined with several less successful films, took a toll on his standing. By 1970, he had fallen out of favor. He spent the early years of the new decade appearing in such lackluster B films as Onde D\u00f3i Mais? (1972) and turning up more frequently on television as a guest on The Dean Martin Show (1965) and a Glen Campbell TV special.In 1974, Inspector Clouseau came to Sellers rescue when Sir Lew Grade expressed an interest in a TV series based on the character. Clouseau's creator, writer-director Blake Edwards, whose career had also seen better days, convinced Grade to bankroll a feature film instead, and A Volta da Pantera Cor-de-Rosa (1975) was a major hit release during the summer of Tubar\u00e3o (1975) and restored both men to prominence. Sellers would play Clouseau in two more successful sequels, A Nova Transa da Pantera Cor-de-Rosa (1976) and A Vingan\u00e7a da Pantera Cor-de-Rosa (1978), and Sellers would use his newly rediscovered clout to realize his dream of playing Chauncey Gardiner in a film adaptation of Jerzy Kosinski's novel \"Being There\". Sellers had read the novel in 1972, but it took seven years for the film to reach the screen. Muito Al\u00e9m do Jardim (1979) earned Sellers his second Oscar nomination, but he lost to Dustin Hoffman for Kramer vs. Kramer (1979).Sellers struggled with depression and mental insecurities throughout his life. An enigmatic figure, he often claimed to have no identity outside the roles that he played. His behavior on and off the set and stage became more erratic and compulsive, and he continued to frequently clash with his directors and co-stars, especially in the mid-1970s when his physical and mental health, together with his continuing alcohol and drug problems, were at their worst. He never fully recovered from his 1964 heart attack because he refused to take traditional heart medication and instead consulted with 'psychic healers'. As a result, his heart condition continued to slowly deteriorate over the next 16 years. On March 20, 1977, Sellers barely survived another major heart attack and had a pacemaker surgically implanted to regulate his heartbeat which caused him further mental and physical discomfort. However, he refused to slow down his work schedule or consider heart surgery which might have expanded his life by several years.On July 25, 1980, Sellers was scheduled to have a reunion dinner in London with his Goon Show partners, Spike Milligan and Harry Secombe. However, at around 12 noon on July 22, Sellers collapsed from a massive heart attack in his Dorchester Hotel room and fell into a coma. He died in a London hospital just after midnight on July 24, 1980 at age 54. He was survived by his fourth wife, Lynne Frederick, and three children: Michael, Sarah and Victoria. At the time of his death, he was scheduled to undergo an angiography in Los Angeles on July 30 to see if if he was eligible for heart surgery.His last movie, O Diab\u00f3lico Dr. Fu Manchu (1980), completed just a few months before his death, proved to be another box office flop. Director Blake Edwards' attempt at reviving the Pink Panther series after Sellers' death resulted in two panned 1980s comedies, the first of which, A Trilha da Pantera Cor-de-Rosa (1982), deals with Inspector Clouseau's disappearance and was made from material cut from previous Pink Panther films and includes interviews with the original casts playing their original characters.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Ashley G.

Scott", "birthPlace": "Wise, Virginia, USA", "birthDate": "1927-10-18", "deathDate": "1999-09-22", "pictureurl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIwNTk5NjkzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTAwOTQ2._V1_.jpg", "bio": "\n\n              George C. Scott was an immensely talented actor, a star of screen, stage and television. He was born on October 18, 1927 in Wise, Virginia, to Helena Agnes (Slemp) and George Dewey Scott. At the age of eight, his mother died, and his father, an executive at Buick, raised him. In 1945, he joined the United States Marines and spent four years with them, no doubt an inspiration for portraying General George S. Patton years later. When Scott left the Marines, he enrolled in journalism classes at the University of Missouri, but it was while performing in a play there that the acting bug bit him. He has said it \"clicked, just like tumblers in a safe.\"It was in 1957 that he landed a role in \"Richard III\" in New York City. The play was a success and brought the young actor to the attention of critics. He soon began to get work on television, mostly in live broadcasts of plays, and he landed the role of the crafty prosecutor in Anatomia de um Crime (1959). It was this role that got him his first Oscar nomination, for Best Supporting Actor.However, George and Oscar wouldn't actually become the best of friends. In fact, he felt the whole process forced actors to become stars and that the ceremony was little more than a \"meat market.\" In 1962, he was nominated again for Best Supporting Actor, this time opposite Paul Newman in Desafio \u00e0 Corrup\u00e7\u00e3o (1961), but sent a message saying \"No, thanks\" and refused the nomination.However, whether he was being temperamental or simply stubborn in his opinion of awards, it did not seem to stop him from being nominated in the future. \"Anatomy\" and \"The Hustler\" were followed by the clever mystery A Lista de Adrian Messenger (1963), in which he starred alongside Kirk Douglas, Robert Mitchum and cameos by major stars of the time, including Burt Lancaster and Frank Sinatra. It's a must-see, directed by John Huston with tongue deeply in cheek.The following year, Scott starred as General \"Buck\" Turgidson in Stanley Kubrick's comical anti-war film Dr. Fant\u00e1stico (1964). This became one of his favorites and he often said that he felt guilty getting paid for it, as he had so much fun making it. Another comedy followed, O Magn\u00edfico Farsante (1967), with Scott playing a smooth-talking con artist who takes on an apprentice whom he soon discovers has too many morals.Three years followed, with some smaller television movies, before he got the role for which he will always be identified: the aforementioned General Patton in Patton, Rebelde ou Her\u00f3i? (1970). This was a war movie that came at the end of a decade where anti-war protests had rocked a nation and become a symbol of youth dissatisfied with what was expected of them. Still, the actor's portrayal of this aggressive military icon actually drew sympathy for the controversial hero. He won the Oscar this time, but stayed at home watching hockey instead.A pair of films that he made in the early 1980s were outstanding. The first of these was Intermedi\u00e1rio do Diabo (1980), a film often packaged as a horror movie but one that's really more of a supernatural thriller. He plays John Russell, a composer and music professor who loses his wife and daughter in a tragic accident. Seeking solace, he moves into an archaic mansion that had been unoccupied for 12 years. However, a child-like presence seems to be sharing the house with him and trying to share its secrets with him. From learning of the house's past, he discovers its horrific secret of long ago, a secret that the presence will no longer allow to be kept.Then he starred -- along with a young cast of then largely unknowns, including Timothy Hutton, Sean Penn and Tom Cruise -- in the intense drama Toque de Recolher (1981). He played the head of a military academy that's suddenly slated for destruction when the property is sold to local developers who plan to build condos. The students take over the academy when they feel that the regular channels are closed to them.Scott kept up in films, television and on stage in the later years of his life (Broadway dimmed its lights for one minute on the night of his death). Among his projects were playing Ebenezer Scrooge in a worthy television update of Um Conto de Natal (1984), an acclaimed performance on Broadway of \"Death of a Salesman\", the voice of McLeach in Disney's Bernardo e Bianca na Terra dos Cangurus (1990) and co-starring roles in television remakes of two classic films, 12 Homens e uma Senten\u00e7a (1997) and O Vento Ser\u00e1 Tua Heran\u00e7a (1999), to name just a few. After his death the accolades poured in, with Jack Lemmon saying, \"George was truly one of the greatest and most generous actors I have ever known,\" while Tony Randall called him \"the greatest actor in American history\".\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Pedro Borges\n          \n\n", "realName": "George Campbell Scott", "height": "183"},

Though very poor, attended prep school at Wassookeag School in Dexter, Maine. Ran away to sea at 17, first as ship's boy, then as doryman on the Grand Banks, as a seaman and fireman on numerous vessels before getting his first command at 19. He sailed around the world a number of times, becoming a well-known and highly respected ship's captain. At urging of friends, met with producer Edward H.

Mother Hilda Keenan was also a minor actress. Born in New York City on July 27, 1916, during the height of his father's Broadway popularity, Keenan grew up in the lap of luxury and was educated at St. John's Military Academy. He initially followed in his grandfather's dramatic footsteps as opposed to his father's clown shoes, making his professional bow in Maine with the Lakewood Players in a production of \"Accent of Youth\". By 1937, he was on Broadway with \"Hitch Your Wagon\" in two small roles. During the run of the show, he met first wife, actress Evie Wynn Johnson, who became his coach, manager and advisor. At the same time, he began to get steady radio work.Through the aid and encouragement of his wife and her contacts, he eventually wrangled screen tests for both 20th Century-Fox and MGM. Turned down by the first studio, he signed with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer at a rather low pay scale of $300 a week. At MGM, Keenan became the utilitarian character player, adept at playing almost anything handed to him. Balding, homely but with real distinctive, imposing features, he made his unbilled debut in Ainda Ser\u00e1s Minha (1942), and went on to play a grab-bag of shady brutes, usually in comic relief style. He was Gene Kelly's agent in Id\u00edlio em Do-Re-Mi (1942), a gangster in O Anjo Perdido (1943), a soldier buddy to Robert Walker in Senhor Recruta! (1944) and its sequel; a drunk in a diner in O Ponteiro da Saudade (1945); Lucille Ball's tipsy beau in the Katharine Hepburn / Spencer Tracy vehicle Sem Amor (1945); and a news editor paired up with Ms. Ball again in Quem Manda \u00e9 o Amor (1946). Moreover, he was given \"B\" co-star assignments in lesser material such as Romance no Rio (1946), Sem Licen\u00e7a Nem Amor (1946) and Milagres a Granel (1946).Two sons were born to Keenan and Eve during the war years but he and Eve soon drifted apart. In 1946, the couple filed divorce papers with a third-party involvement in the form of family close friend and MGM star Van Johnson. Eve went on to marry Johnson the day after the couple's divorce was decreed in 1947. Keenan's second marriage in 1949 to Betty Jane Butler lasted only four years.He resigned with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in the postwar years and ventured on as one of Hollywood's strongest character players. The drawback was that not many of his roles were high-quality challenges, roles that might have moved him toward the top of the MGM hierarchy. The more scene-stealing roles that came to him were his disagreeable, self-important burlesque star in the Clark Gable starrer Mercador de Ilus\u00f5es (1947); his jazz reedman in A Can\u00e7\u00e3o dos Acusados (1947); and the songwriter friend to Kirk Douglas in Minha Secret\u00e1ria Favorita (1948). He was also given his quota of vulgar, blunt-talking villains to play, both comically and dramatically, in such films as Gosto Deste Bruto (1950), Bondade Fatal (1951) and, in particular, his Runyonesque gangster in the musical classic D\u00e1-me um Beijo (1953). Partnered with co-hort James Whitmore, their rendering of \"Brush Up Your Shakespeare\" was one of many comedy highlights. He also doled out a number of brash soldier types in such films as Meu Amigo, o Le\u00e3o (1952), Campo de Batalha (1953), A Gota de Sangue (1953) and Esquadr\u00e3o Her\u00f3ico (1954).After leaving Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1954, he set his sights on television, but the lure of films (and steady work) never stopped. In A Luz de uma Ilus\u00e3o (1956), Keenan finally appeared with father Ed Wynn, who had suffered a major career slide and subsequent nervous breakdown. Keenan, who at one time had gone to great lengths to extricate himself from his father's famous shadow, was now an instrument of encouragement. He suggested the elder Wynn abandon his old-styled clowning in favor of a serious character acting. His father agreed to try and appeared in a small role in the film but they had no scenes together. The risk worked. The following year both were being hailed for their superlative work together in the dramatic television production Playhouse 90: Requiem for a Heavyweight (1956).Disney employed both father and son in the 1960s with a mustachioed Keenan as an exceptionally hissable villain in the studio's comedy feature O Fant\u00e1stico Super-Homem (1961) and its sequel, O Fabuloso Criador de Encrencas (1963). His hammy antics were spurred on in Dr. Fant\u00e1stico (1964), A Corrida do S\u00e9culo (1965), Viva Max! (1969) and Garotas Lindas aos Montes (1971), along with standard, if not always stand-out, television work. His annoying, fast-talking conmen, scheming tycoons and other unappetizing cronies never lost their demand. In 1975, he earned an Emmy Award nomination for his guest-starring role on Police Woman (1974).Though his later years were marred by a severe case of tinnitus (a ringing in the ear that blocks out exterior sound), he was able to continue acting until the very end. One of his last roles was as a regular on the short-lived television series Deloucacia de Pol\u00edcia (1986). Sons Ned Wynn (\"Edmund\") and Tracy Keenan Wynn became successful writers in the business. On October 14, 1986, Keenan Wynn died of pancreatic cancer at age 70 and was survived by third wife Sharley Jean Hudson, who had three daughters by him: Hilda, Emily and Edwina. His granddaughter Jessica Keenan Wynn (Edwina's daughter) is also a Broadway singer and actress.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Gary Brumburgh / gr-home@pacbell.net\n          \n\n", "realName": "Francis Xavier Aloysius James Jeremiah Keenan Wynn", "height": "178"},

His great-grandfather was the first Tyrone Power (1795-1841), a famed Irish comedian. His father, known to historians as Tyrone Power Sr., but to his contemporaries as either Tyrone Power or Tyrone Power the Younger, was a huge star in the theater (and later in films) in both classical and modern roles. His mother, Helen Emma \"Patia\" (n\u00e9e Reaume), (Mrs. Tyrone Power), was also a Shakespearean actress as well as a respected dramatic coach.Tyrone Edmund Power, Jr., (also called Tyrone Power III) was born at his mother's home of Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1914. His ancestry included English, Irish, German, French Huguenot, and French-Canadian. A frail, sickly child, he was taken by his parents to the warmer climate of southern California. After his parents' divorce, he and his sister Anne Power returned to Cincinnati with their mother. There he attended school while developing an obsession with acting. Although raised by his mother, he corresponded with his father, who encouraged his acting dreams. He was a supernumerary in his father's stage production of 'The Merchant of Venice' in Chicago and held him as he died suddenly of a heart attack later that year.Startlingly handsome, young Tyrone nevertheless struggled to find work in Hollywood. He appeared in a few small roles, then went east to do stage work. A screen test led to a contract at 20th Century Fox in 1936, and he quickly progressed to leading roles. Within a year or so, he was one of Fox's leading stars, playing in contemporary and period pieces with ease. Most of his roles were colorful without being deep, and his swordplay was more praised than his wordplay. He served in the Marine Corps in World War II as a transport pilot, and he saw action in the Pacific Theater of operations.After the war, he got his best reviews for an atypical part as a downward-spiraling con-man in O Beco das Almas Perdidas (1947). Although he remained a huge star, much of his postwar work was unremarkable. He continued to do notable stage work and also began producing films. Following a fine performance in Billy Wilder's Testemunha de Acusa\u00e7\u00e3o (1957), Power began production on Salom\u00e3o e a Rainha de Sab\u00e1 (1959). Halfway through shooting, he collapsed during a dueling scene with George Sanders, and he died of a heart attack before reaching a hospital.His three children, including his namesake, Tyrone William Power IV (known professionally as Tyrone Power Jr.), have all followed him in the family acting tradition.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Jim Beaver <jumblejim@prodigy.net>\n          \n\n", "realName": "Tyrone Edmund Power Jr.", "height": "180"},

She entered the cabaret scene in 1920s Germany, first as a spectator then as a cabaret singer. In 1924, she married and, although she and Rudolf Sieber lived together only 5 years, they remained married until his death. She was in over a dozen silent films in increasingly important roles. In 1929, she was seen in a Berlin cabaret by Josef von Sternberg and, after a screen test, captured the role of the cabaret singer in O Anjo Azul (1930) (and became von Sternberg's lover). With the success of this film, von Sternberg immediately took her to Hollywood, introducing her to the world in Marrocos (1930), and signing an agreement to produce all her films. A series of successes followed, and Marlene became the highest paid actress of her time, but her later films in the mid-part of the decade were critical and popular failures. She returned to Europe at the end of the decade, with a series of affairs with former leading men (she had a reputation of romancing her co-stars), as well as other prominent artistic figures. In 1939, an offer came to star with James Stewart in a western and, after initial hesitation, she accepted.

Her parents, James \"Shamus\" Sullivan and Edith \"Biddy\" Lanchester, were socialists - very active members of the Social Democratic Federation (SDF) in a rather broad sense and did not believe in the institution of marriage and being tied to any conventions of legality for that matter. Her mother had actually been committed to an asylum in 1895 by her father and older brothers because of her unmarried state with James. The incident received worldwide press as the \"Lanchester Kidnapping Case\".Elsa had a great desire to become a classical dancer and to that end at age 10 her mother enrolled her at the famed Isadora Duncan's Bellevue School in Paris in 1912. But the uncertainties of WW1 brought her home after only two years. At age 12, she was sent to a co-educational boarding school in Kings Langley, Hertfordshire, England, to teach dance classes in exchange for her education and board. In 1918, she was hired as a dance teacher at Margaret Morris's school on the Isle of Wight.Next to dance, she loved the music halls of the period, so in 1920 she debuted in a music hall act as an Egyptian dancer. About the same time she founded the Children's Theater in Soho, London and taught there for several years. She made her stage debut in 1922 in the West End play Thirty Minutes in a Street. In 1924 she and her partner, Harold Scott, opened a London nightclub called the Cave of Harmony. They performed one-act plays by Pirandello and Chekhov and sang cabaret songs. She would later collect and record these and many others. The spot was frequented by literati like Aldous Huxley, H.G. Wells and also James Whale, working in London theater and soon to be directing on Broadway and Hollywood's most famous horror films. Lanchester kept busy including, on her own admission, posing nude for artists. During a 1926 comic performance in the Midnight Follies at London's Metropole, a member of the British Royal family walked out as she sang, \"Please Sell No More Drink to My Father\". She closed her nightclub in 1928 as her film career began in earnest.Perhaps not beautiful in the more conventional sense, Lanchester was certainly pretty as a young woman with a turned-up nose that gave her a pert, impish expression, all the more striking with her large, expressive dark eyes and full lips. She had a lithe figure that she carried with the assuredness of her dancing background. Her voice was bright and distinctive, and had a delightful rush and trill that had an almost Scottish burr quality. What clicked on stage would do the same in the movies.Her first film appearance was actually in an amateur movie by friend and author Evelyn Waugh called The Scarlet Woman: An Ecclesiastical Melodrama (1925). Her formal film debut was in the British movie One of the Best (1927). She continued stage work and became associated in 1927 with a rather self-possessed but keenly dedicated actor, Charles Laughton. He appeared with her in three of four films Lanchester did in 1928. Three of these were written for her by H.G. Wells). They did a few plays as well and wed in 1929. According to Lancester, after two years, she discovered he was homosexual but they remained married until his death in 1962. Lanchester declared in a 1958 interview that she kept to a separate career path from her husband. They appeared together on occasion -- moving through 1931 with several smart play-like films including Potiphar's Wife (1931) with Laurence Olivier. She had done the play Payment Deferred in London in 1930 and followed it to Broadway in 1931.MGM offered her a contract in 1932. In 1933 Alexander Korda was casting his Os Amores de Henrique VIII (1933) and decided that Laughton was the perfect choice - and his wife would be just as perfect as one of Henry's six wives. Her versatility pointed to a part with some comedic elements and fitting more into a caricature. She looked most like Hans Holbein's famous portrait of Anne of Cleves (Henry's fourth wife who was actually somewhat more homely than the painter depicted). In costume Lanchester was charming if not striking. Her interpretation of Anne was a perfect integration with herself, and her scene with Laughton informally playing cards on the marriage bed and deciding on annulment is a highpoint of the movie.Of course, it would be hard to mention her film career of the 1930s without mentioning the one role that would forever dog her, A Noiva de Frankenstein (1935). Having come to Hollywood with Laughton in 1932 (but not permanently until 1939), Lanchester did only a few films up to 1935 and was disappointed enough with Hollywood's reception to return to London for a respite. She was quickly called back by old friend from London, stage and film associate James Whale, now the noted director of Frankenstein (1931) and O Homem Invis\u00edvel (1933). He wanted her for two parts in Bride: author Mary Shelley and the bride. A central joke of the movie build-up was the tag lines: \"WHO will be The Bride of Frankenstein? WHO will dare?\"Indeed, it was no honeymoon for her. For some ten days, Lanchester was wrapped in yards of bandage and covered in heavy makeup. The stand-on-end hairdo was accomplished by combing it over a wire mesh cage. Lanchester was in real agony with her eyes kept taped wide open for long takes - and it showed in her looks of horror. Her monster's screaming and hissing sounds (based on the sounds of Regents Park swans in London) were taped and then run backward to spook-up the effect. She was delightfully melodramatic and picturesque as Wollstonecraft, and her bride would become iconic. Many have considered A Noiva de Frankenstein (1935) the best of the golden age horror movies. Lanchester stood out in her next movie with Laughton the next year, Korda's dark Rembrandt (1936), but she only did a few more films for the remainder of the decade. Through the 1940s she was doubly busy -- a couple of films per year while regenerating her beloved musical revue sketches. She performed for 10 years at the Turnabout Theater in Hollywood, using old London music hall/cabaret songs and others written for her. Later she would have to split her time further doing a similar act at a supper club called The Bar of Music. By the later 1940s she had become rather matronly, and the roles would settle appropriately. But she always lent her sparkle, as with her charming maid Matilda in Um Anjo Caiu do C\u00e9u (1947). She would be nominated for best supporting actress in Falam os Sinos (1949).She entered the 1950s busy with road touring of her nightclub act with pianist J. Raymond Henderson (who went by \"Ray\" and who is sometimes confused with popular songwriter Ray Henderson). There was a series of tours to complement Laughton's famous reading tours, called Elsa Lanchester's Private Music Hall which ended in 1952; Elsa Lanchester--Herself which ended in 1961; and once more in 1964 at the Ivar Theater. She was equally busy with a stock of film roles and a large share of TV playhouse theater. She made ten movies with Laughton, the last of which, Testemunha de Acusa\u00e7\u00e3o (1957) garnered her second supporting actress nomination. But her dizzy Aunt Queenie Holroyd of Sortil\u00e9gio do Amor (1958) is a fond remembrance of that time.With the two decades from the 1960s to early 1980s, Lanchester was a fixture on episodic TV and an institution in Disney and G-rated fare -- perhaps a bit ironic for the unconventional Lanchester. She wrote two autobiographies: \"Charles Laughton and I\" (1938) and \"Elsa Lanchester: Herself\" (1983), both recalling her nearly 100 roles before the camera. Lanchester remained humorously reflective in regard to her film career: \"...large parts in lousy pictures and small parts in big pictures.\" It was the mix of silly, bawdy, and outrageous in her revues that was her great joy: \"I was content because I was fully aware that I did not like straight acting but preferred performing direct to an audience. You might call what I do vaudeville. Making a joke, especially impromptu, and getting a big laugh is just plain heaven.\"\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            William McPeak\n          \n\n", "realName": "Elsa Sullivan Lanchester", "height": "163"},

However, the versatile actor has been steadily working on both stage and screen since his television debut in the miniseries Irm\u00e3os de Guerra (2001). After being cast in the World War II drama, Hardy left his studies at the prestigious Drama Centre in London and was subsequently cast as Twombly in Ridley Scott's Falc\u00e3o Negro em Perigo (2001) and as the villain Shinzon in Jornada Nas Estrelas: N\u00eamesis (2002).Edward Thomas Hardy was born on September 15, 1977 in Hammersmith, London; his mother, Elizabeth Anne (Barrett), is an artist and painter, and his father, Chips Hardy, is a writer. He is of English and Irish descent. Hardy was brought up in East Sheen, London, and first studied at Reed's School. His education continued at Tower House School, then at Richmond Drama School, and subsequently at the Drama Centre London, along with fellow Oscar nominee Michael Fassbender. After winning a modeling competition at age 21, he had a brief contract with the agency Models One.Tom spent his teens and early twenties battling delinquency, alcoholism and drug addiction; after completing his work on Jornada Nas Estrelas: N\u00eamesis (2002), he sought treatment and has also admitted that his battles with addiction ended his five-year marriage to Sarah Ward. Returning to work in 2003, Hardy was awarded the Evening Standard Most Promising Newcomer Award for his theatre performances in the productions of \"In Arabia, We'd All Be Kings\" and \"Blood\". In 2003, Tom also co-starred in the play \"The Modernists\" with Paul Popplewell, Jesse Spencer and Orlando Wells.During the next five years, Hardy worked consistently in film, television and theatre, playing roles as varied as Robert Dudley in the BBC's Elizabeth I: A Rainha Virgem (2005), Bill Sikes in Oliver Twist (2007) and starring in \"The Man of Mode\" at the National Theatre. On the silver screen, he appeared in the crime thriller Nem Tudo \u00e9 o Que Parece (2004) with Daniel Craig, Sofia Coppola's Maria Antonieta (2006), and the romp Cenas de Natureza Sexual (2006).In 2006, Hardy created \"Shotgun\", an underground theatre company along with director Robert Delamere, and directed a play, penned by his father for the company, called \"Blue on Blue\". In 2007, Hardy received a best actor BAFTA nomination for his touching performance as Stuart Shorter in the BBC adaptation of Alexander Masters' bestselling biography Stuart: Uma Vida Revista (2007). Hailed for his transformative character acting, Hardy was lauded for his emotionally and physically convincing portrayal in the ill-fated and warmhearted tale of Shorter, a homeless and occasionally violent man suffering from addiction and muscular dystrophy.The following year, he appeared as gay hoodlum Handsome Bob in the Guy Ritchie film Rock'n'Rolla: A Grande Roubada (2008), but this would be his next transformation that would prove his extensive range and stun critics. In the film Bronson (2008), Hardy played the notorious Charles Bronson (given name, Michael Peterson), the \"most violent prisoner in Britain\". Bald, pumped-up, and outfitted with Bronson's signature strongman mustache, Hardy is unrecognizable and gives a harrowing performance that is physically fearless and psychologically unsettling. Director Nicolas Winding Refn breaks the fourth wall with Hardy retelling his tales directly to viewers as well as performing them outright before an audience of his own imagining. The performance mixes terrifying brutality, vaudevillian showmanship, wry humor, and an alarming amount of commitment, and won Hardy a British Independent Film Award for Best Actor. The performance got Hollywood's attention, and in 2009, Hardy was named one of Variety's \"10 Actors to Watch\". That year, he continued to garner praise for his starring role in The Take (2009), a four-part adaptation of Martina Cole's bestselling crime novel, as well as for his performance as Heathcliff in a version of O Morro dos Ventos Uivantes (2009).Recent work includes the aforementioned breakthrough appearance in A Origem (2010) alongside Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, Ken Watanabe, Michael Caine, Marion Cotillard and Ellen Page. The movie was released in July 2010 and became one of top 25 highest grossing films of all time, collecting eight Oscar nominations (including Best Picture) and winning four.Other films include Guerreiro (2011), opposite Joel Edgerton, the story of two estranged brothers facing the fight of a lifetime from director Gavin O'Connor, and Guerra \u00e9 Guerra! (2012), directed by McG and co-starring Reese Witherspoon and Chris Pine. Tom also starred in the heralded Cold War thriller, O Espi\u00e3o Que Sabia Demais (2011) with Colin Firth and Gary Oldman. Hardy rejoined Christopher Nolan for Batman: O Cavaleiro das Trevas Ressurge (2012); he played the villain role of Bane opposite Christian Bale, Anne Hathaway, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Gary Oldman. Hardy's menacing physique and his character's scrambled, hard-to-distinguish voice became a major discussion point as the film was released.Outside of performing, Hardy is the patron for the charity \"Flack\", which is an organization to aid the recovery of the homeless in Cambridge. And in 2010, Hardy was named an Ambassador for The Prince's Trust, which helps disadvantaged youth. On the recent stage, he starred in the Brett C. Leonard play \"The Long Red Road\" in early 2010. Written for Hardy and directed by Philip Seymour Hoffman, the play was staged at Chicago's Goodman Theater.In 2015, Hardy starred as the iconic Mad Max in George Miller's reboot of his franchise, Mad Max: Estrada da F\u00faria (2015). He also collected a British Independent Film Award for his portrayal of both the Kray twins, Ronnie and Reggie, in Lendas do Crime (2015), and an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his role as John Fitzgerald in O Regresso (2015). Hardy also starred on the BBC series Peaky Blinders: Sangue, Apostas e Navalhas (2013), alongside Cillian Murphy, and on the television series Taboo (2017), both created by Steven Knight.He has an outlaw biker story among other projects in development. In 2010, Hardy became engaged to fellow English actress Charlotte Riley, whom he starred with in The Take (2009) and O Morro dos Ventos Uivantes (2009), and is raising a young son, Louis Thomas Hardy, with ex-girlfriend Rachael Speed.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Pedro Borges\n          \n\n", "realName": "Edward Thomas Hardy", "height": "175"},

He grew up in Warwick, Rhode Island, with his mother and stepfather Thomas E. Dixon. He graduated from Pilgrim High School in 1965, near the top of his class. James earned a scholarship to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; dropping out during his sophomore year in 1967, he then headed off to New York with his fraternity brother Martin Donovan to pursue aspirations to appear on the stage. After appearing in a handful of New York City theater productions, Woods scored his first film role in All the Way Home (1971) and followed that up with meager supporting roles in Nosso Amor de Ontem (1973) and Garotos do Coro (1977).However, it was Woods' cold-blooded performance as the cop killer in Assassinato a Sangue Frio (1979), based on a Joseph Wambaugh novel, that seized the attention of movie-goers to his on-screen power. Woods quickly followed up with another role in another Joseph Wambaugh film adaptation, Lembran\u00e7as Amargas (1980), as a sleazy and unstable cable-T.V.-station owner in David Cronenberg's mind-bending and prophetic Videodrome: A S\u00edndrome do V\u00eddeo (1983), as gangster Max Bercovicz in Sergio Leones mammoth epic Era uma Vez na Am\u00e9rica (1984), and scored a best actor Academy Award nomination as abrasive journalist Richard Boyle in Oliver Stone's gritty and unsettling Salvador: O Mart\u00edrio de um Povo (1986).There seemed to be no stopping the rise of this star as he continued to amaze movie-goers with his remarkable versatility and his ability to create such intense, memorable characters. The decade of the 1990s started off strongly with high praise for his role as Roy Cohn in the television production of Cidad\u00e3o Cohn (1992). Woods was equally impressive as sneaky hustler Lester Diamond who cons Sharon Stone in Cassino (1995), made a tremendous H.R. Haldeman in Nixon (1995), portrayed serial killer Carl Panzram in Confiss\u00f5es de um Assassino (1995), and then as accused civil rights assassin Byron De La Beckwith in Fantasmas do Passado (1996).Not to be typecast solely as hostile hoodlums, Woods has further expanded his range to encompass providing voice-overs for animated productions including H\u00e9rcules (1997), A Rena Robbie e a Grande Corrida (1999), and O Pequeno Stuart Little 2 (2002). Woods also appeared in the critically praised As Virgens Suicidas (1999), in the coming-of-age movie Os Garotos da Minha Vida (2001), as a corrupt medico in Um Domingo Qualquer (1999), and in the comedy-horror spoof Todo Mundo em P\u00e2nico 2 (2001).

Working summers with the nearby Fulton Repertory Theatre at Lancaster in the heart of Amish country, Williams performed the classics as well as contemporary dramas and musicals. After graduating, Williams--whose first name, incidentally, is a family surname on his mother's side--headed for Manhattan where he understudied the Danny Zuko role in \"Grease.\" After working in the The Andrews Sisters musical \"Over Here,\" he made his film debut as a cop in Deadly Hero (1975), then returned to \"Grease,\" this time in the starring role. While he took leaves for two small film roles, in A Sauna das Loucas (1976) and A \u00c1guia Pousou (1976), it was his stage work in \"Grease\" that led to his cinematic breakthrough in Hair (1979). Spotted by director Milos Forman, Williams was asked to read for the role of Berger, the hippie. It took 13 auditions to land the part, but the film's release catapulted Williams into stardom. He then portrayed a GI on the make in Steven Spielberg's 1941: Uma Guerra Muito Louca (1979) and starred in the romantic comedy Why Would I Lie? (1980) before tackling the role of Danny Ciello, the disillusioned New York City cop who blew the whistle on his corrupt colleagues in Sidney Lumet's O Pr\u00edncipe da Cidade (1981). He followed that with A Fuga de D.B.

Williams has also returned to Broadway sporadically -- first to appear in \"Once in a Lifetime\" while filming \"Hair,\" and in 1981 to play the role of the pirate king in \"The Pirates of Penzance.\"\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            frankfob2@yahoo.com\n          \n\n", "realName": "Richard Treat Williams", "height": "178"},

As he also played young Minamoto no Yoshitsune in NHK 2005's Y Taiga drama Yoshitsune, he literately portrayed the whole life of Minamoto no Yoshitsune on small screens.Another important work by Kamiki in 2012 is the Japanese-Academy-Award-Wining film Kirishima, bukatsu yamerutteyo(The Kirishima Thing). While almost the entire young Japanese actor generation shined in the film, Ry\u00fbnosuke Kamiki still managed to give an impressive performance as the leading star, and he influences other young actors, many acting for the first time, to give their best performance as a \"senior\" actor.2013 is another productive year as the first year after Kamiki graduated from high school and became a full-time actor. Apart from continuing to act in the SPEC series film and acting in TV Mini-Series Kogure shashinkan, Kamiki played alongside Sh\u00f4 Sakurai in TV drama Kazoku g\u00eamu. His performance is so overwhelmingly good that he won the best supporting actor in 77th Drama Academy Awards while the highly-praised drama swept the awards. In 2015 he co-starred with Takeru Satoh in the well-received comic-based movie Bakuman. as Akito Takagi. While the movie is about two high school students working hard as professional Japanese manga artists for Jump Magazine, Kamiki said Akito Takagi is one of the roles that are most similar to himself, as he has been a long-time manga lover.Ry\u00fbnosuke Kamiki is widely loved and appreciated by many famous Japanese actors and screenwriters. He cooperated with well-acclaimed Japanese screenwriter and director, Kankuro Kudo for the first time in 2011, playing the main character in Kudo's TV drama 11 nin mo iru!. They worked together again in Kudo's 2016 film Too Young to Die, and Kamiki was cast for Kudo's 2019 NHK Taiga drama Idaten: Tokyo Olympics Banashi.Ry\u00fbnosuke Kamiki also cooperated with director Keishi Ohtomo several times, who is famous for making good comics-adapted movies. Kamiki played Sojiro Seta in Keishi Ohtomo's 2011 film Rur\u00f4ni Kenshin: Ky\u00f4to taika-hen(Rurouni Kenshin: Kyoto Inferno) and Rur\u00f4ni Kenshin: Densetsu no saigo-hen(Rurouni Kenshin: The Legend Ends), and as a fan of the original manga series Rur\u00f4ni Kenshin and Sojiro Seta, Kamiki practised for the role even before he was officially cast for it. He is also the first choice for Rei Kiriyama, the main character of 3-gatsu no raion zenpen(March Comes in Like a Lion)(2017), and he even got a rank for Amateur Shogi players during his preparation for the role as Rei Kiriyama is a professional Shogi Player.Apart from his acting career, Kamiki has a stunning career as a voice actor. He became one of the favorite voice actors of Hayao Miyazaki when he was young, dubbing for B\u00f4 in Hayao Miyazaki's Oscar-winning animation movies Spirited Away in 2001. His performance is so good that Hayao Miyazaki invited him to work in another well-acclaimed animation movies of the Studio Ghibli, Howl's Moving Castle, in 2004. He also played the major character in Ghibli Museum exclusive short film The Day I Harvested a Planet.Kamiki stated to work with animation director Hiromasa Yonebayashi when the latter was still working in Studio Ghibli. In 2010, Hiromasa Yonebayashi based the main character, Sho, of his directorial debut, The Secret World of Arrietty on Ry\u00fbnosuke Kamiki, and he also invited Kamiki to become the voice of the character. After Hiromasa Yonebayashi started his own animation studio, STUDIO PONOC, he invited Kamiki to dub for the main male character, Peter, in the first long animation of the studio, Mary and the Witch's Flower in 2017.Other famous animation directors who worked with Kamiki included Mamoru Hosoda and Masayuki Kojima. Kamiki dubbed for the main character of Masayuki Kojima 's Piano no mori(Piano Forest) in 2007, and he played the main character of Mamoru Hosoda enjoyable and well-received film Sam\u00e2 u\u00f4zu(Summer Wars) in 2009. He also worked as a voice actor in a Doraemon movie(Doraemon: Nobita's Dinosaur 2006) and in 2011 animation movie The Princess and the Pilot.Kamiki's highlight in his career as a voice actor came in 2016 when he dubbed for the main character in Makoto Shinkai's widely accepted animated romantic fantasy drama film Your name. As his character, Taki Tachibana, switches bodies with the major female character, Mitsuha, Kamiki gave a wonderful performance of dubbing both for Taki and Mitsuha in Taki's body, winning Best Actor in 11th Seiyu Awards for his performance. The film is a worldwide success with high grossing as well as widespread acclaims from critics and the general public, while it also became one of the best-selling films worldwide and the second highest grossed domestic films in Japanese film history, which make Ry\u00fbnosuke Kamiki the only actor who acts in all three top-grossing Japanese domestic films. (The other two is Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle.)Kamiki enjoys photographing and he even won an award for his photographs. He is also a big fan of railway and an enthusiastic manga lover.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            SCSchubert\n          \n\n", "realName": null, "height": "165"},

She is of German and British Isles ancestry. Her family moved to California when she was young, and she grew up there. She graduated from San Francisco State University and began her acting career with the American Conservatory Theatre in San Francisco, eventually moving to New York where she acted on the stage (including a Tony-award nomination in 1987 for her work in the Broadway play \"Coastal Disturbances\") and got her first film roles, in a few TV movies.As is so often the case, her first big-screen role was in a forgettable movie, As Grandes F\u00e9rias (1988), in which she had little screen time. However, her next work onscreen was in Milos Forman's Valmont - Uma Hist\u00f3ria de Sedu\u00e7\u00f5es (1989), a film adaptation of Choderlos de Laclos' \"Les Liaisons Dangereuses\". Unfortunately, de Laclos' story had also just served as the source of a more Hollywoodized and successful movie version, Liga\u00e7\u00f5es Perigosas (1988), which had been released the previous year, and Foreman's treatment went little noticed. Bening's career turned an important corner the following year when she co-starred with Anjelica Huston and John Cusack in Stephen Frears's powerful, entertaining screen adaptation of Jim Thompson's novel Os Imorais (1990), and her artful turn as a con artist gained her the first of several Academy award nominations. On the strength of this performance Warren Beatty cast Bening as Virginia Hill, Bugsy Siegel's fiery actress moll, in his Bugsy (1991), the story of Siegel's founding of Las Vegas. Although the movie itself did not fare well, it resulted in a relationship with Beatty which led to Bening's pregnancy and then her marriage to Beatty in 1992 - it was the second marriage for Bening, who had been separated from her first husband since 1986 but did not finalize her divorce until 1991. The couple then collaborated on the extravagant flop Segredos do Cora\u00e7\u00e3o (1994), though the next year her career rebounded with her turn as Queen Elizabeth in the highly-regarded 1995 production of Ricardo III (1995). Notable performances have since included an obsessive, pushy real estate agent in Beleza Americana (1999), and as the eponymous character in Istv\u00e1n Szab\u00f3's screen adaptation of the W. Somerset Maugham novel Ador\u00e1vel J\u00falia (2004) - both were duly noted by the Academy, with Oscar nominations.Bening has great poise and screen presence and, at her best, can turn in a very strong performance. Although her resume often features long stretches of mediocre productions before the next good part turns up, when it does, it proves worth the wait. Bening has four children with Beatty.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Larry-115\n          \n\n", "realName": "Annette Francine Bening", "height": "173"},

It's hard to believe that the actress, who slunk into stardom with her turn as the disillusioned daughter in Beleza Americana (1999), is even related to the apple-cheeked blonde who once gazed up at Quaker Oats (R) spokesman Wilford Brimley and said, \"Mmm-hmm. Yeah, grandpa\", but Birch still remembers the professional advice Brimley whispered in her ear: maintain eye contact and *really* listen. Since then, she's had ample opportunity to study some of Hollywood's top talents at work - in addition to her Beleza Americana (1999) scenes with Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening, she's acted alongside Harrison Ford, Harvey Keitel and Jeremy Irons. Named after Thor, the Norse god of thunder, Thora was born in Los Angeles to Jack Birch and Carol Connors Birch (they kept up the tempestuous theme by naming her younger brother Bolt Birch). By age 4, she was a regular at commercial auditions and, by age 6, she'd landed a spot on the short-lived daycare sitcom Day by Day (1988). Her film career got off to an auspicious start that same year, when she won a Young Artist Award for her debut opposite Neil Patrick Harris in the children's fantasy flick Um Alien\u00edgena do Barulho (1988). After a short break, she picked up a role in another fleeting sitcom, Parenthood (1990) (based on the movie of the same name). By age 9, Birch had her life pretty much figured out - she told the L.A. Times that she planned to become a director by 24, then spend a year ice skating, then spend a year as a policewoman, and, finally, become a singer. She picked up her last name (early appearances credited her as just \"Thora\") and returned to the big screen as Elijah Wood's tomboy friend in Para\u00edso (1991). She then scored a high-profile supporting role as Harrison Ford's daughter in Jogos Patri\u00f3ticos (1992), which she reprised in Perigo Real e Imediato (1994). In between, she kept busy with family films Abracadabra (1993) and Meu Pequeno Ladr\u00e3o (1994). In 1995, Birch graduated into adolescent territory with her turn as a younger Melanie Griffith in Agora e Sempre (1995). She followed that up with a top-billed role in the snowy adventure Alaska: Uma Aventura Inacredit\u00e1vel (1996), then took a three-year hiatus from acting. She resurfaced in 1999, first in the made-for-TV Night Ride Home (1999) and then, more visibly, in Beleza Americana (1999). Birch had heard about \"Beauty\" through the industry grapevine, and she immediately set her sights on the part of \"Jane Burnham\". As it turned out, she was the first to audition for director Sam Mendes; while he saw dozens of other actresses for the role, none delivered a more convincing \"Jane\". Still reeling from her sudden celebrity status, Birch plucked a handful of diverse projects from the deluge of post-\"Beauty\" scripts. Seeking an even edgier adolescent role, she appeared as a punk-rocker in the indie film The Smokers (2000), then dropped the tough-girl pose to play the gentle \"Empress Savina\" in the live-action adaptation of Dungeons & Dragons: A Aventura Come\u00e7a Agora (2000). She also signed up to play a teen hipster caught up in a post-high school identity crisis in Ghost World: Aprendendo a Viver (2001) (based on the graphic novel), and an English schoolgirl in the thriller O Buraco (2001). Style-conscious and sophisticated beyond her years, Birch lives on her family's East L.A. ranch (where she recently finished high school through a computer-based correspondence course). She still hopes to try her hand at directing someday, but, for now, she's content to continue blossoming in front of the camera.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            IMDb Editors\n          \n\n", "realName": null, "height": "163"},

His mother was Irish, from County Longford, while his American-born father is of mostly Irish descent.Mel and his family moved to Australia in the late 1960s, settling in New South Wales, where Mel's paternal grandmother, contralto opera singer Eva Mylott, was born. After high school, Mel studied at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, performing at the National Institute of Dramatic Arts alongside future film thespians Judy Davis and Geoffrey Rush.After college, Mel had a few stints on stage and starred in a few TV shows. Eventually, he was chosen to star in the films Mad Max (1979) and Tim - Anjos de A\u00e7o (1979), co-starring Piper Laurie. The small budgeted Mad Max made him known worldwide, while Tim garnered him an award for Best Actor from the Australian Film Institute (equivalent to the Oscar).Later, he went on to star in Gallipoli (1981), which earned him a second award for Best Actor from the AFI. In 1980, he married Robyn Moore and had seven children. In 1984, Mel made his American debut in Rebeli\u00e3o em Alto Mar (1984), which co-starred Anthony Hopkins.Then in 1987, Mel starred in what would become his signature series, M\u00e1quina Mort\u00edfera (1987), in which he played \"Martin Riggs\". In 1990, he took on the interesting starring role in Hamlet (1990), which garnered him some critical praise. He also made the more endearing Eternamente Jovem (1992) and the somewhat disturbing O Homem sem Face (1993). 1995 brought his most famous role as \"Sir William Wallace\" in Cora\u00e7\u00e3o Valente (1995), for which he won two Oscars for Best Picture and Best Director.From there, he made such box office hits as O Patriota (2000), O Pre\u00e7o de um Resgate (1996), and O Troco (1999). Today, Mel remains an international superstar mogul, continuously topping the Hollywood power lists as well as the Most Beautiful and Sexiest lists.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            TrendEkiD@aol.com -Rowspacing by Tony Hedlund\n          \n\n", "realName": "Mel Columcille Gerard Gibson", "height": "177"},

His parents moved to Ireland when he was very young and McGoohan acquired a neutral accent that sounds at home in British or American dialogue. He was an avid stage actor and performed hundreds of times in small and large productions before landing his first TV and film roles. McGoohan is one of few actors who has successfully switched between theater, TV, and films many times during his career. He was often cast in the role of Angry Young Man. In 1959, he was named Best TV Actor of the Year in Britain. Shortly thereafter, he was chosen for the starring role in the Danger Man (1964) TV series (AKA 'Secret Agent in the US), which proved to be an immense success for three years and allowed the British to break into the burgeoning American TV market for the first time. By the series' 3rd year, McGoohan felt the series had run its course and was beginning to repeat itself. McGoohan and Lew Grade - the president of ITC (the series' production company), had agreed that McGoohan could leave Danger Man to begin work on a new series, and turned in his resignation right after the first episode of the fourth year had been filmed (\"Koroshi\"). McGoohan set up his own production company and collaborated with noted author and script editor George Markstein to sell a brand new concept to ITC's Lew Grade. McGoohan starred in, directed, produced, and wrote many of the episodes, sometimes taking a pseudonym to reduce the sheer number of credits to his name. Thus, the TV series The Prisoner (1967) came to revolve around the efforts of a secret agent, who resigned early in his career, to clear his name. His aim was to escape from a fancifully beautiful but psychologically brutal prison for people who know too much. The series was as popular as it was surreal and allegorical, and its mysterious final episode caused such an uproar that McGoohan was to desert England for more than 20 years to seek relative anonymity in LA, where celebrities are \"a dime a dozen.\"During the 1970s, he appeared in four episodes of the TV detective series \"Columbo,\" for which he won an Emmy Award. His film roles lapsed from prominence until his powerful performance as King Edward I (Longshanks) in Mel Gibson's production of Cora\u00e7\u00e3o Valente (1995). As such, he has solidified his casting in the role of Angry Old Man.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            <sysop@hal9k.com> <UNOwen>\n          \n\n", "realName": "Patrick Joseph McGoohan", "height": "187"},

He has been in a variety of different films and television shows over his life, playing such well known roles as Edward 'Blackbeard' Teach, Robert the Bruce, and Orson Welles.Born in Glasgow, Scotland on the twenty-first of September in 1963, Angus lived a colourful childhood, being raised in such places as the Philippines, Singapore, and France. Angus found himself back in Britain, however, when it came to education. He enrolled in the University of Edinburgh, and Central School of Speech and Drama in London.Angus' first role was the role of Philip in the film made for television, Great Performances: The Lost Language of Cranes (1991). The film centers on a young man (Angus) who must tell his parents that he is gay. Playing the role of his father was fellow Scottish actor Brian Cox. Angus then acted in the television film 15: The Life and Death of Philip Knight (1993) and also on the television show Takin' Over the Asylum (1994) which was about a salesman who runs a radio station in an institution. This led to the biggest role of Angus's career.In 1995, Mel Gibson's epic classic, Cora\u00e7\u00e3o Valente (1995) was released, with Angus in the role of Robert the Bruce. Next to the flamboyantly hero of William Wallace, Robert the Bruce was the human character, the man who wanted to make the right choice, but was drawn to compromise. The brilliant portrayal of the Bruce was sadly unnoticed by any awards, a tragic insult to Angus's brilliant performance.After Cora\u00e7\u00e3o Valente (1995) won Best Picture, Angus acted in the independent film Nevada (1997), before giving the most over-the-top performance of his career in the action/fantasy Guerreiros da Virtude (1997). While the movie was a disaster critically and commercially, Angus's performance as the demented villain Komodo is fondly remembered by a cult following to this day. Another role for Angus was in the romantic comedy A Garota dos Meus Sonhos (1997). Regrettably, none of these matched up to Cora\u00e7\u00e3o Valente (1995)'s success. He moved on to Joseph's Gift (1998) which starred Freddy Rodr\u00edguez. Angus also co-starred alongside such names as Don Cheadle and Ray Liotta when he played Peter Lawford in the HBO film Os Maiorais (1998).Angus also played the role of Orson Welles in Tim Robbins's third directorial film O Poder Vai Dan\u00e7ar (1999). Although the film received a nomination for the Palme D'Or at Cannes, it was a financial flop, but Angus rebounded with the Shakespearean film Titus (1999) which also featured Anthony Hopkins, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Alan Cumming and Jessica Lange. Angus played the role of Lucius, eldest son of Titus Andronicus (played by Hopkins). Directed by Julie Taymor, who would go on to direct Across the Universe (2007), the film was a critical triumph and Angus delivered a solid performance, but with mediocre box office results. With the new millennium, Angus once again took up a very well-known character: the Greek God Zeus in A Vingan\u00e7a do Gladiador (2000).After the noir film Matadora de Aluguel (2000), Angus acted in a number of poorly received films. One such film was the action film Styx (2001) which starred Peter Weller. A year later, Angus acted in the comedy film Divinos Segredos (2002) alongside a number of famous names as Sandra Bullock, Ellen Burstyn, Maggie Smith, and Ashley Judd. The film was a commercial hit, albeit with mixed reviews. That same year, Angus took the role of Vice-Counsel Dupont in Equilibrium (2002). The film, also starring Christian Bale, Sean Bean, Taye Diggs, and Emily Watson, is about a world set in the future, where a Fascist regime forbids all emotions from being shown. The film, though clearly well-made and well-acted by all, did not get a wide release. It had already made a profit through international sales, and the studio chose to keep it a successful profit rather than risk a big release. Equilibrium (2002) has since gained a cult following, but at the time of its initial release, Angus moved on to act in the television series Milagres: Entre o C\u00e9u e o Inferno (2003) which was about the supernatural.After \"Miracles\", Angus acted as Marcus Crassus in a more historically accurate version of Stanley Kubrick's film Spartacus (1960), the character of Bill in \"The Pleasure Drivers\", and the lead in the dramatic film A Virgem De Juarez (2006). He then played the pirate warlord Blackbeard in a television film of the same name. The film received mixed reviews.What then emerged was the second role of MacFadyen's career: the role of Jeff Reinhart in Jogos Mortais 3 (2006). Reinhart is a man obsessed with revenge, and he is led into a series of traps that test his ability to forgive. The film was a smash hit for its 10 million dollar budget, earning almost two hundred million dollars worldwide. Angus co-starred in the box office bomb Redline: Velocidade sem Limites (2007) the same year as he returned to the \"Saw\" franchise with the fourth film. It was also a success at the box office, though reviews for this film were lower than the previous films.Angus continues making films, starring as the outlaw Will Tunney in his new western film Shadowheart (2009), which may be a reference to the film that made him famous. Angus has appeared on television in the series \"Californication\" and \"Killer Wave\". He has also acted in the upcoming mystery film \"San Saba (2008)\" and the thriller film Clean Break (2008). His character of Jeff makes a reappearance in Jogos Mortais 5 (2008), and he acted in two thrillers. One is the film Pound of Flesh (2010) alongside Malcolm McDowell which revolves around a corrupt college professor, and the other is the crime thriller Na Mira da Morte (2013) alongside Christian Slater. Angus has also acted in the second season of Engana-me se Puder (2009), to positive acclaim. Additionally, Angus has joined the cast of the upcoming action film \u00daltimo Samurai (2012) alongside Wes Bentley, and the Cameron Crowe comedy Compramos Um Zool\u00f3gico (2011), starring Matt Damon.Hopefully he continues to make more films, and one of these days he will win a hard-earned and long-deserving award for his troubles and successes.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Bob Stage\n          \n\n", "realName": null, "height": "180"},

Both films had the military and scientists clash, also both had choppers all over the place.Then came Air Force One (1997), about terrorists taking over the presidents plane. This film had shades of a 1970s Airport disaster film.The Perfect Storm (2000) came next, and while the script about a boat at sea in a storm was okay, the constant fake looking computer generated sea water damaged the film.And then came Poseidon (2006), about a passenger ship turning over at sea. Outbreak just hinted at being an Irwin Allen remake, but with Poseidon it was now official..this was a remake of Allen's The Poseidon Adventure (1972). The new Poseidon movie was Petersen's worst action/disaster movie by a long way.

Using classic \"method acting\" and an adopted technique inspired by his seniors Sanjeev Kumar, Rajesh Khanna, Dev Anand and Shammi Kapoor, Aamir acts in all genres of Indian films - comedy, action, drama and romance. He is regarded as a complete Indian actor of the post 1990 generation of actors for his diverse choice of roles and films.

It made a total of Rs.202 crores domestically and Rs.400 crores on the worldwide box office, becoming the highest overseas grosser to date, a staggering feat given that no other film had even come close to making Rs.100 crores on the domestic box office until then, except for his own Ghajini (2008) the previous year.Aamir is said to be the actor who first started the trend of actors working in one film at a time, when the others worked in four or five at the same time.

His mother, Josephine (Stello) Abraham, was the daughter of Italian immigrants. Born with the first name \"Murray\", he added an \"F.\" to distinguish his stage name.Primarily a stage actor, Abraham made his screen debut as an usher in the George C. Scott comedy Esse Louco Me Fascina (1971). By the mid-1970s, Murray had steady employment as an actor, doing commercials and voice-over work. He can be seen as one of the undercover police officers along with Al Pacino in Sidney Lumet's Serpico (1973), and in television roles including the villain in one third-season episode of Kojak (1973). His film work of those years also included the roles of a cabdriver in O Prisioneiro da Segunda Avenida (1975), a mechanic in Uma Dupla Desajustada (1975), and a police officer in Todos os Homens do Presidente (1976).Beyond these small roles, Abraham continued to do commercials and voice-over work for income. But in 1978, he decided to give them up. Frustrated with the lack of substantial roles, Abraham said, \"No one was taking my acting seriously. I figured if I didn't do it, then I'd have no right to the dreams I've always had\". His wife, Kate Hannan, went to work as an assistant and Abraham became a \"house husband\". He described, \"I cooked and cleaned and took care of the kids. It was very rough on my macho idea of life. But it was the best thing that ever happened to me\". Abraham appeared as drug dealer Omar Su\u00e1rez alongside Pacino again in the gangster film Scarface (1983). He also gained visibility voicing a talking bunch of grapes in a series of television commercials for Fruit of the Loom underwear.In 1985 he was honored with as Academy Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role for the acclaimed role of envious composer Antonio Salieri in Amadeus (1984), an award for which Tom Hulce, playing Mozart in that movie, had also been nominated. He was also honored with a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture - Drama, among other awards, and his role in the film, is still considered to be his most iconic as the film's director Milos Forman inspired the work of the role with Abraham's wide range of qualities as a great stage and film actor.After Amadeus, he next appeared in O Nome da Rosa (1986), in which he played Bernardo Gui, nemesis to Sean Connery's William of Baskerville. In the DVD audio commentary, his director on the film, Jean-Jacques Annaud, described Abraham as an \"egomaniac\" on the set, who considered himself more important than Sean Connery, since Connery did not have an Oscar. That said, the film was a critical success. Abraham had tired of appearing as villains and wanted to return to his background in comedy, as he also explained to People Weekly magazine in an interview he gave at the time of its release.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Pedro Borges\n          \n\n", "realName": "Murray Abraham", "height": "178"},

He is the son of Joanna (Winkleman), who had sung professionally, and Raymond Albert Hulce, who worked for Ford. He has English, German, and Irish ancestry. Wanting to be a singer, Tom had to make a switch in plans when his voice began changing. Knowing that if he wanted to be in show business he needed to become an actor, Tom began taking the necessary steps almost immediately.When asked once why he chose acting Tom replied, \"Because someone told me I couldn't.\" It is determination like this that has helped him achieve his respected position in the acting community to this day. Tom set goals early on. Graduating from school at 19 years old, he gave himself a decade to succeed as an actor. Working in Ann Arbor as usher and ticket seller with a small theatrical company was a start. It was around this time he saw the first play and actor that made him realize that acting was \"cool.\" Christopher Walken was in a play in Stratford, Ontario. The performance made quite an impression on Tom.While Mr. and Mrs. Hulce weren't totally sold on the idea of their son becoming a thespian, Tom had determination and headed off for the training he knew he'd need if he was going to achieve his goal. He studied at the North Carolina School of the Arts in Winston-Salem; at Booth Bay Harbor, Maine; Sarasota, Florida; and spent a summer in England before heading off to New York City to try his hand at Broadway. Within a month after his arrival, Tom was chosen to understudy the role being performed by Peter Firth in the Broadway play \"Equus.\" He had originally been hired to play one of the horses, but it was decided that his time was better spent learning the understudy role and so he never donned the horse's attire.Tom had pangs of guilt where this role was concerned. On one hand he wanted the role ... badly. On the other hand he wondered what would happen if Peter left the role; could he fill those shoes? When the time came, nine months after being hired, Tom found out that it was up to him to play the role as his own. He wasn't expected to be another Peter Firth... he had been hired to play the role his way. \"... it actually went quite well, \" Tom recalled. \"I realized I was a different actor and that I would tackle the part in my own way.\" And tackle it he did! Equus has a few \"firsts\" for Tom. One, it was his first big role; two, it was his first Broadway role and third, it was his first nude performance. For nine minutes Tom and his costar, Roberta Maxwell, were naked in a scene that seemed impossible for the stage a decade earlier (1960s). In a past interview Tom reflected, \"It's so skillfully written and developed that it doesn't seem an unusual thing to do. There's no embarrassment, I just don't think about it at all.\" During the run of \"Equus,\" Tom turned down a big television offer, to the delight of the director and cast. At that time in Tom's life the stage was all there was, and he was going to do it right! Other plays that followed \"Equus\" were George S. Kaufman's \"Butter and Egg Man,\" Arthur Miller's \"Memory of Two Mondays,\" along with such works as \"Julius Caesar,\" \"Romeo and Juliet,\" Shaw's \"Candida,\" and Chekhov's \"The Sea Gull,\" and, again on Broadway in his Tony nominated role in Aaron Sorkin's \"A Few Good Men.\"Tom has even directed the off-Broadway musical \"Sleep Around Town\" at Playwrights Horizon. Back in 1977 Tom landed his first motion picture role in the film about the day James Dean died, September 30, 1955 (1977). This was to be the first of a long line of period films. His next was National Lampoon's Clube dos Cafajestes (1978). Set in the 1960's, Tom played \"Pinto\" along with such comedy alumni as 'John Belushi', Tim Matheson, and Donald Sutherland.1984 gave him the role that put him on the map. The title role of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in the Oscar-winner Amadeus (1984) was such a wonder that it even boosted the sales of Mozart's music by 30%! Filmed in Prague, it was eerie for Tom to actually be standing in the very spot where the original Amadeus had stood conducting the opera Tom was recreating for the film. Dressed in a purple velvet jacket, knickers, and white hose, wearing a bushy white wig and doling out a hilarious laugh (often likened to that of a hyena's) Tom's portrayal of the \"man-child\" musical genius was an Oscar-nominated performance.Tom has been in many more films set in the past: Those Lips, Those Eyes (1980)(1950s), Shadowman (1988) (World War II), Mary Shelley's Frankenstein de Mary Shelley (1994) (1800s), Asas da Coragem (1995)(1930's), and Disney's O Corcunda de Notre Dame (1996)(1500s). Tom appeared in Echo Park (1985) with Susan Dey, a film that had a struggle to get released remains one of Tom's best performances and one that he is quite proud of. Another film that Tom feels a lot of pride for is Dominick e Eugene (1988). Starring with Ray Liotta and Jamie Lee Curtis, Tom played Dominick Luciano, a mentally handicapped twin brother to Liotta's Eugene. The young man works as a garbage collector to help put his brother through medical school so he can become a \"rich doctor\" and they can afford to get a \"house by a lake.\" Tom spent time studying people in a Pittsburgh neighborhood and handicapped people in an occupational training center so he could master the innocence and determination that the lead role required. He received the Best Actor award at the Seattle Fest for his performance.Assassinato no Mississipi (1990) was Tom's second television movie (the first was Great Performances: Forget-Me-Not-Lane (1975) (aka \"Neli, Neli\"), a Hallmark Hall of Fame production). Playing the role of Michael Schwerner, the New York social worker and Freedom Fighter who is murdered by K.K.K. members in 1964 during Freedom Summer, Tom received an Emmy nomination and his third Golden Globe nomination.O C\u00edrculo do Poder (1991) (aka \"The Projectionist\") took Tom to Russia where he was Ivan Sanshin, the private film projectionist to Stalin within the Kremlin walls. Based on a true story, Ivan was a perfect example of how many were blinded to the horrific conditions that men like Stalin conducted and followed in ignorant loyalty. While there, Tom was fortunate to meet and spend time with Alexander Ganshin, upon whose life the film was based.The next three years held special items for Tom. His portrayal of Peter Patrone, in T.N.T.'s Lembran\u00e7as de uma Paix\u00e3o (1995), earned him an Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or Special, and 1994 and 1996 brought two of Tom's last period pieces. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein de Mary Shelley (1994) had Tom playing opposite Kenneth Branagh as Victor Frankenstein's college chum, Henry. And 1996 was a whole new experience for Tom. Disney was looking for someone special to portray their gentle Quasimodo in their newest full feature animation motion picture, O Corcunda de Notre Dame (1996).Tom had never done voiceover work for a full film; to sing before a microphone was one thing, but to do song and voice for someone that he couldn't watch while performing was a whole new experience for him. Herecalled that when he first auditioned he thought it strange that the producers and director stood looking at the floor while he sang...until he noticed they were looking at sketches of Quasimodo and were trying to \"feel\" if he sounded like their bell ringer.1998 saw Tom returning to the stage but this time as director again, as he undertook the enormous task of bringing John Irving's 1985 novel, \"The Cider House Rules\", to the stage. An 8-hour production which required the audience two days to see the whole performance, it was quite an undertaking. Co-directing with Jane Jones (of \"BookIt\" in Seattle, Washington) Tom took the play from its Seattle opening to the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles, California where it received wonderful reviews.During the past recent years Tom has resided in Seattle, Washington where he owns his own home. He figures he could live in Los Angeles or New York - the acting hubs - but in Seattle, he's near the things he loves. \"Up in Seattle people look after their lives in a way you can't do in New York or Los Angeles,\" he says. But no matter where he calls home, we can always count on Tom for bringing us into a world that will thrill, excite, fascinate, move and inspire us either through his films, the stage, or his beautiful singing.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Jane Byron Dean <Tom_Hulce_Ultimate_Webpage@yahoo.com>\n          \n\n", "realName": "Thomas Edward Hulce", "height": "173"},

He was the first-born child of Louis and Neva Dotrice who prospered as bakers. The Germans occupied the island in 1940 and he and his mother and brother escaped to England.Advancing his real age, Roy joined the Royal Air Force at age 16 and was trained as a wireless operator and air gunner. In 1942 his plane was shot down and he was captured where he served out the remainder of WWII (over three years) as a prisoner of war in Germany. He was introduced to the idea of performing when he took part in various makeshift concerts in order to raise the spirits of his fellow captives.Following WWII and his release, Roy decided to pursue his acting ambitions. After studying at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, he began appearing in English repertory where he met and married (1947) actress Kay Dotrice who at the time was performing under her given name of Katherine (Kay) Newman. Throughout the early post-war years, the couple performed together in repertory with Charles Denville and the Denville Players. At different times he was a member of the Liverpool, Manchester and Oldham repertory theatres. Also during this great time of productivity, Roy produced and directed some three hundred stage plays. He formed his own troupe, the Guernsey Theatre Company, in 1955. The highlight of his theatrical career, however, began in 1957 when Roy became a member of the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre at Stratford, England, (later the Royal Shakespeare Company). For the next nine years he performed in a lengthy succession of the Bard's works, first in small parts as various players, officers and gentlemen. He subsequently went on to become a notable Iago, Falstaff and Julius Caesar, among others. A popular performer, he had an uncanny ability to play much older than he was. He later went on to perform with the American Shakespearean Festival.The notoriety he received from his abundant classical theatre experience led directly to radio, film, television and Broadway offers. Roy has appeared in a number of Broadway productions over the years, receiving a Tony nomination for his work in \"A Life\" and finally winning the trophy for his heralded performance in the 2000 revival of \"A Moon for the Misbegotten\" starring Cherry Jones and Gabriel Byrne. Known for his considerable success in one-man shows such as Abraham Lincoln, Charles Dickens, Will Rogers and Winston Churchill, his superb one-person show \"Brief Lives\", drawn from the Elizabethan diaries of John Aubrey, played for over 1,700 performances over a period of nearly a decade. At one time this set a record for a solo performance and was listed in the \"Guinness Book of World Records\".Dotrice made his credited feature movie debut supporting Kirk Douglas and Richard Harris in Os Her\u00f3is de Telemark (1965), and has since lent class and distinction to a spattering of films. Among his list of credits include the bawdy comedy As Virgens Impacientes (1969); the sumptuous biopic Nicholas e Alexandra (1971); the Oscar-winning Amadeus (1984), Milos Forman's adaptation of composer Mozart's life in which Roy portrayed Mozart's stern and domineering father Leopold; and Um Casal Quase Perfeito (1992) as an Olympic skating coach.Perhaps better remembered on the small screen, he appeared magnanimously as a host of monarchs including his Edward IV in The Wars of the Roses (1965) and King George IV in the syndicated miniseries Shaka Zulu (1986). To American audiences he is probably best known as Jacob Wells, the Beast's surrogate father, in the dramatic series Beauty and the Beast (1987). Dotrice was also cast in the recurring role of Father Barrett, a Catholic priest and confidante of Judge Henry Bone (played by Ray Walston), on the acclaimed Emmy-winning drama Picket Fences (1992).Since the end of the 1970s he has lived and worked primarily in America. More recently he appeared on stage reviving his outstanding 1993 role as George Bernard Shaw in \"The Best of Friends\" in 2006. His devoted wife Kay died on August 2, 2007, after 60 years of marriage. The couple has three daughters (Michele, Karen, Yvette), all whom at one time or another were actresses. Karen, who is now primarily out of the business, became the best known perhaps for her childhood Disney portrayals, notably in Mary Poppins (1964). Combined, his daughters have presented him with seven grandchildren.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Gary Brumburgh / gr-home@pacbell.net\n          \n\n", "realName": "Roy Louis Dotrice", "height": "175"},

His mother, Ann, was a teacher and landscape painter. His father, Ernie, was a journalist who had changed the family name from \"Smith\" to \"Roth\"; Ernie was born in Brooklyn, New York, to an immigrant family of Irish ancestry.Tim grew up in Dulwich, a middle-class area in the south of London. He demonstrated his talent for picking up accents at an early age when he attended school in Brixton, where he faced persecution from classmates for his comfortable background and quickly perfected a cockney accent to blend in. He attended Camberwell Art College and studied sculpture before he dropped out and pursued acting.The blonde actor's first big break was the British TV movie Made in Britain (1982). Roth made a huge splash in that film as a young skinhead named Trevor. He next worked with director Mike Leigh on Meantime (1983), which he has counted among his favorite projects. He debuted on the big screen when he filled in for Joe Strummer in the Stephen Frears neo-noir O Traidor (1984). Roth gained more attention for his turn as Vincent Van Gogh in Van Gogh - Vida e Obra de um G\u00eanio (1990) and his work opposite Gary Oldman in Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Est\u00e3o Mortos (1990).He moved to Los Angeles in search of work and caught the eye of young director Quentin Tarantino. Tarantino had envisioned Roth as a possible Mr. Blonde or Mr. Pink in his heist flick C\u00e3es de Aluguel (1992), but Roth campaigned for the role of Mr. Orange instead, and ultimately won the part. It proved to be a huge breakthrough for Roth, as audiences found it difficult to forget his performance as a member of a group of jewelry store robbers who is slowly bleeding to death. Tarantino cast Roth again in the landmark film Pulp Fiction: Tempo de Viol\u00eancia (1994). Roth and actress Amanda Plummer played a pair of robbers who hold up a restaurant. 1995 saw the third of Roth's collaborations with Tarantino, a surprisingly slapstick performance in the anthology film Grande Hotel (1995). That same year Roth picked up an Academy Award nomination for his campy turn as a villain in the period piece Rob Roy, a Saga de uma Paix\u00e3o (1995).Continuing to take on disparate roles, Roth did his own singing (with an American accent to boot) in the lightweight Woody Allen musical Todos Dizem Eu Te Amo (1996). He starred opposite Tupac Shakur in Shakur's last film, the twisted comedy Gridlock'd - Na Contra-M\u00e3o (1997). The pair received positive critical notices for their comic chemistry. Standing in contrast to the criminals and baddies that crowd his CV, Roth's work as the innocent, seafaring pianist in the Giuseppe Tornatore film A Lenda do Pianista do Mar (1998) became something of a fan favorite. Grittier fare followed when Roth made his directorial debut with Zona de Conflito (1999), a frank, critically acclaimed drama about a family torn apart by incest. He made his next high-profile appearance as an actor as General Thade, an evil simian in the Tim Burton remake of O Planeta dos Macacos (2001). Roth was, of course, all but unrecognizable in his primate make-up.Roth has continued to enjoy a mix of art house and mainstream work, including everything from the lead role in Francis Ford Coppola's esoteric Velha Juventude (2007) to becoming \"The Abomination\" in the special effects-heavy blockbuster O Incr\u00edvel Hulk (2008). Roth took his first major American television role when he signed on to the Fox-TV series Engana-me se Puder (2009)\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Azure_Girl\n          \n\n", "realName": "Timothy Simon Smith", "height": "170"},

His siblings are musician Michael Penn and actor Sean Penn. His father was from a Lithuanian Jewish/Russian Jewish family, and his mother is of half Italian and half Irish descent.Penn set out to follow in his parents' footsteps and started acting at age twelve in the Loft Studio. While in high school he and his brother Sean made several shorts with their classmates, which included such would-be stars as Emilio Estevez and Rob Lowe. Penn made his onscreen debut in the Christopher Cain movie, Charlie and the Talking Buzzard (1979). After a few years Penn caught the eye of acclaimed director Francis Ford Coppola, who cast him in a supporting role in the teen drama O Selvagem da Motocicleta (1983). Although the film was a flop critically and commercially, Penn's career was well under way.That same year he acted in A Chance (1983), a high school drama film starring a young Tom Cruise. The next year Penn gave a performance in Footloose: Ritmo Louco (1984), starring Kevin Bacon and dealing with a small town which bans rock & roll music. The movie was a smash hit, and remains a classic to this day. Penn followed this up with a villainous role in Clint Eastwood's O Cavaleiro Solit\u00e1rio (1985), and the crime movie Caminhos Violentos (1986), starring Christopher Walken.Penn acted in a few smaller productions until he was cast as Travis Brickley in the sports drama Opera\u00e7\u00e3o Kickbox (1989). Penn's character is a martial arts fighter who joins the other main characters when they enter a taekwondo tournament against the Korean team. The movie spawned several sequels, though Penn only appeared in the first and second films. A few more jobs followed until Penn landed what is known as his most famous movie: Quentin Tarantino's C\u00e3es de Aluguel (1992). The indie crime film concerned a heist gone wrong, as the criminals search for a rat in their midst. Penn played the role of Nice Guy Eddie, the son of the old gangster that arranges the heist. The film continues to receive acclaim as a classic movie and as the start of Tarantino's directing career. Penn also acted in the Tarantino-scripted Tony Scott crime movie Amor \u00e0 Queima Roupa (1993), albeit in a much smaller role. Penn also took a supporting role in the ensemble film Short Cuts - Cenas da Vida (1993) by Robert Altman.After participating in these acclaimed films, Penn took on several smaller projects, including a role as the villain in the second \"Beethoven\" movie. In this period of time, Penn acted in such films as the crime film O Pre\u00e7o da Trai\u00e7\u00e3o (1996), set in the 1950s. Penn then gave one of his greatest performances in the Abel Ferrara crime drama Os Chef\u00f5es (1996). The movie starred Christopher Walken, Penn, and Vincent Gallo as three brothers who are involved in the world of crime, even as it threatens to take them all down. Penn plays Chez, the middle brother, who has a very short temper. Penn also sang a song in the film as his character. While the film was well received critically and Penn received an award for Best Supporting Actor at the Venice Film Festival for his excellent performance, Os Chef\u00f5es (1996) went largely unseen. Penn followed up with the Canadian film Clube dos garotos (1996), the crime thriller Entre o Dever e a Amizade (1998), and a supporting role in the hit comedy A Hora do Rush (1998).Following his latest success, Penn acted in the drama-comedy The Florentine (1999), the English comedy Kiss Kiss (Bang Bang) (2001), and the crime thriller C\u00e1lculo Mortal (2002). Penn was also one of the many stars that acted in the box office failure A M\u00e1scara do Anonimato (2003), starring Bob Dylan. The last few years of his career mainly featured supporting roles in such movies as Ladr\u00e3o de Diamantes (2004), Starsky & Hutch, Justi\u00e7a em Dobro (2004), and the Canadian crime film King of Sorrow (2007), his last film appearance. Throughout his life Penn had had battles with heart disease and multiple drug use. He was found dead in his home on January 24, 2006. He was only forty years old.Penn left behind a career that featured many roles in small, independent productions as well as several very well known films. Penn worked with several esteemed directors and fellow actors, lending his talent to both television and film.

Roth, a psychoanalyst, psychiatrist, and clinical professor. His family is Jewish (from Austria, Hungary, Russia, and Poland). He began shooting Super 8 films at the age of eight, after watching Ridley Scott's Alien, o Oitavo Passageiro (1979) and vomiting, and deciding he wanted to be a producer/director. With his brothers and friends, ketchup for blood and his father's power tools, he made over fifty short films before attending film school at N.Y.U., where he won a student Academy Award and graduated Summa Cum Laude in 1994.Eli worked in film and theater production in New York City for many years, doing every job from production assistant to assistant editor to assistant to the director. At the age of 20 Roth was development head for producer Fred Zollo, a position he soon left to write full time. To earn a living, Roth did budgets and schedules for the films Um Pre\u00e7o Acima dos Rubis (1998) and Illuminata (1998) and often worked as a stand-in, where he could watch directors work with the actors. In 1995, Roth co-wrote the script that would eventually become Cabana do Inferno (2002) with friend Randy Pearlstein, and the two spent many years unsuccessfully trying to get the film financed. Roth left New York in 1999 to live in Los Angeles, and within four months got funding for his animation series Chowdaheads (1999). Roth and friend Noah Belson (Cabana do Inferno (2002)'s Guitar Man) wrote and voiced the episodes, which Roth produced, directed and designed. The episodes were due to run on W.C.W.'s #1 rated series WCW Monday Nitro (1995) but the C.E.O. was fired a day before they were scheduled to air, and the episodes never ran. Roth used the episodes to set up a stop motion series called The Rotten Fruit (2003) which he produced, directed and animated, as well as co-wrote and voiced with friend Belson. Between the two animated series, Roth worked closely with director David Lynch, producing content for the website davidlynch.com.In 2001, Roth filmed Cabana do Inferno (2002) on a shoestring budget of $1.5 million, with private equity he and his producers raised from friends and family. The film was the subject of a bidding war at the 2002 Toronto Film Festival, eventually won by Lion's Gate, instantly doubling their investors' money. It went on to not only be the highest grossing film for Lion's Gate in 2003, but the most profitable horror film released that year, garnering critical acclaim from The New York Times, Rolling Stone, Empire Magazine, and such filmmakers as Peter Jackson, Quentin Tarantino and Tobe Hooper. Roth used the film's success to launch a slew of projects, including A Caixa (2009), a horror thriller he co-wrote with Richard Kelly. In May of 2003, Roth joined forces with filmmakers Boaz Yakin, Scott Spiegel, and Greenestreet Films in New York to form Raw Nerve, LLC, a horror film production company.In 2014, Eli married Chilean model and actress Lorenza Izzo.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Scott Harbinson\n          \n\n", "realName": "Eli Raphael Roth", "height": "183"},

He made his feature starring debut playing the title role in Popeye (1980), directed by Robert Altman.Williams' continuous comedies and wild comic talents involved a great deal of improvisation, following in the footsteps of his idol Jonathan Winters.

His mother, Chris Anne (n\u00e9e Boldt), is a school teacher, and his father, Timothy Byers Affleck, is a social worker; the two are divorced. Ben has a younger brother, actor Casey Affleck, who was born in 1975. He is of mostly English, Irish, German, and Scottish ancestry. His middle name, G\u00e9za, is after a Hungarian family friend who was a Holocaust survivor.Affleck wanted to be an actor ever since he could remember, and his first acting experience was for a Burger King commercial, when he was on the PBS mini-series, The Voyage of the Mimi (1984). It was also at that age when Ben met his lifelong friend and fellow actor, Matt Damon. They played little league together and took drama classes together. Ben's teen years consisted of mainly TV movies and small television appearances including Hands of a Stranger (1987) and The Second Voyage of the Mimi (1988). He made his big introduction into feature films in 1993 when he was cast in Jovens, Loucos e Rebeldes (1993). After that, he did mostly independent films like Kevin Smith's Barrados no Shopping (1995) and Procura-se Amy (1997) which were great for Ben's career, receiving renowned appreciation for his works at the Sundance film festival. But the success he was having in independent films didn't last much longer and things got a little shaky for Ben. He was living in an apartment with his brother Casey and friend Matt, getting tired of being turned down for the big roles in films and being given the forgettable supporting ones. Since Matt was having the same trouble, they decided to write their own script, where they could call all the shots. So, after finishing the script for G\u00eanio Indom\u00e1vel (1997), they gave it to their agent, Patrick Whitesell, who showed it to a few Hollywood studios, finally being accepted by Castle Rock. It was great news for the two, but Castle Rock wasn't willing to give Ben and Matt the control over the project they were hoping for. It was friend Kevin Smith who took it to the head of Miramax who bought the script giving Ben and Matt the control they wanted and, in December 5, 1997, G\u00eanio Indom\u00e1vel (1997) was released, making the two unknown actors famous. The film was nominated for 9 Academy Awards and won two, including Best Original Screenplay for Ben and Matt. The film marked Ben's breakthrough role, in which he was given for the first time the chance to choose roles instead of having to go through grueling auditions constantly.Affleck chose such roles in the blockbusters Armageddon (1998), Shakespeare Apaixonado (1998), and Pearl Harbor (2001). In the early years of the 2000s, he also starred in the box office hits Fora de Controle (2002), A Soma de Todos os Medos (2002), and Demolidor - O Homem sem Medo (2003), as well as the disappointing comedies Contato de Risco (2003) and Sobrevivendo ao Natal (2004). While the mid 2000s were considered a career downturn for Affleck, he received a Golden Globe nomination for his performance in Hollywoodland - Bastidores da Fama (2006). In the several years following, he played supporting roles, including in the films A \u00daltima Cartada (2006), Ele N\u00e3o Est\u00e1 T\u00e3o a Fim de Voc\u00ea (2009), Intrigas de Estado (2009), and Mar\u00e9 de Azar (2009). He ventured into directing in 2007, with the thriller Medo da Verdade (2007), which starred his brother, Casey Affleck, and was well received. He then directed, co-wrote, and starred in Atra\u00e7\u00e3o Perigosa (2010), which was named to the National Board of Review Top Ten Films of the year. For the political thriller Argo (2012), which he directed and starred in, Affleck won the Golden Globe Award and BAFTA Award for Best Director, and the Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, and BAFTA Award for Best Picture (Affleck's second Oscar win).In 2014, Affleck headlined the book adaptation thriller Garota Exemplar (2014). He starred as Bruce Wayne/Batman in the superhero film Batman vs Superman: A Origem da Justi\u00e7a (2016), briefly reprised the character in Esquadr\u00e3o Suicida (2016), and did so again in Liga da Justi\u00e7a (2017).Affleck married actress Jennifer Garner in 2005. The couple has three children. In June 2015, Affleck and Garner separated, and in April 2017 they filed for divorce.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            TrendEkiD@aol.com and Pedro Borges\n          \n\n", "realName": "Benjamin G\u00e9za Affleck-Boldt", "height": "192"},

His father managed a construction company. His mother, Pauline Schlesinger, was Jewish but converted to Catholicism when Lang was ten. After high school, he enrolled briefly at the Technische Hochschule Wien and then started to train as a painter. From 1910 to 1914, he traveled in Europe, and he would later claim, also in Asia and North Africa. He studied painting in Paris from 1913-14. At the start of World War I, he returned to Vienna, enlisting in the army in January 1915. Severely wounded in June 1916, he wrote some scenarios for films while convalescing. In early 1918, he was sent home shell-shocked and acted briefly in Viennese theater before accepting a job as a writer at Erich Pommer's production company in Berlin, Decla. In Berlin, Lang worked briefly as a writer and then as a director, at Ufa and then for Nero-Film, owned by the American Seymour Nebenzal. In 1920, he began a relationship with actress and writer Thea von Harbou (1889-1954), who wrote with him the scripts for his most celebrated films: Dr. Mabuse, o Jogador (1922), Os Nibelungos - A Morte de Siegfried (1924), Metr\u00f3polis (1927) and M, o Vampiro de Dusseldorf (1931) (credited to von Harbou alone). They married in 1922 and divorced in 1933. In that year, Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels offered Lang the job of head of the German Cinema Institute. Lang--who was an anti-Nazi mainly because of his Catholic background--did not accept the position (it was later offered to and accepted by filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl) and, after secretly sending most of his money out of the country, fled Germany to Paris. After about a year in Paris, Lang moved to the United States in mid-1934, initially under contract to MGM. Over the next 20 years, he directed numerous American films. In the 1950s, in part because the film industry was in economic decline and also because of Lang's long-standing reputation for being difficult with, and abusive to, actors, he found it increasingly hard to get work. At the end of the 1950s, he traveled to Germany and made what turned out to be his final three films there, none of which were well received.In 1964, nearly blind, he was chosen to be president of the jury at the Cannes Film Festival. He was an avid collector of primitive art and habitually wore a monocle, an affectation he picked up during his early days in Vienna. After his divorce from von Harbou, he had relationships with many other women, but from about 1931 to his death in 1976, he was close to Lily Latte, who helped him in many ways.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            A.

Although he has always been the lead vocals, rhythm guitar, and songwriter for American band Thirty Seconds to Mars, Leto is an accomplished actor merited by the numerous, challenging projects he has taken in his life. He is known to be selective about his film roles.Jared Leto was born in Bossier City, Louisiana, to Constance \"Connie\" (Metrejon) and Anthony L. \"Tony\" Bryant. The surname \"Leto\" is from his stepfather. His ancestry includes English, Cajun (French), as well as Irish, German, and Scottish. Jared and his family traveled across the United States throughout his childhood, living in such states as Wyoming, Virginia and Colorado. Leto would continue this trend when he initially dropped a study of painting at Philadelphia's University of the Arts in favor of a focus on acting at the School of Visual Arts in New York City.In 1992, Leto moved to Los Angeles to pursue a musical career, intending to take acting roles on the side. Leto's first appearances on screen were guest appearances on the short-lived television shows Camp Wilder (1992), Almost Home (1993) and Rebel Highway (1994). However, his next role would change everything for Leto. While searching for film roles, he was cast in the show, Minha Vida de C\u00e3o (1994) (TV Series 1994-1995). Leto's character was \"Jordan Catalano\", the handsome, dyslexic slacker, the main love interest of \"Angela\" (played by Claire Danes). Leto contributed to the soundtrack of the film, and so impressed the producers initially that he was soon a regular on the show until its end.Elsewhere, Leto began taking film roles. His first theatrically released film was the ensemble piece, Colcha de Retalhos (1995), based on a novel of the same name and starring renowned actresses Winona Ryder, Anne Bancroft, Ellen Burstyn, Jean Simmons and Alfre Woodard. The film was a modest success and, while Leto's next film, Tempos de Rebeldia (1996), was a failure, Leto secured his first leading role in Prefontaine (1997), based on long-distance runner Steven Prefontaine. The film was a financial flop, but was praised by critics, notably Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert. He also took a supporting role in the action thriller, Um Assassino \u00e0 Solta (1997), which starred Dennis Quaid, but the film was another failure.Leto's work was slowly becoming recognized in Hollywood, and he continued to find work in film. In 1998, everything turned for the better on all fronts. This was the year that Leto founded the band, Thirty Seconds to Mars, with his brother, Shannon Leto, as well as Matt Wachter (who later left the group), and after two guitarists joined and quit, Tomo Milicevic was brought in as lead guitarist and keyboardist. As well as the formation of his now-famous band, Leto's luck in film was suddenly shooting for the better. He was cast as the lead in the horror film, Lenda Urbana (1998), which told a grisly tale of a murderer who kills his victims in the style of urban legends. The film was a massive success commercially, though critics mostly disliked the film. That same year, Leto also landed a supporting role in the film, Al\u00e9m da Linha Vermelha (1998). Renowned director Terrence Malick's first film in nearly twenty years, the film had dozens of famous actors in the cast, including Sean Penn, Woody Harrelson, John Travolta, Nick Nolte and Elias Koteas, to name a few. The film went through much editing, leaving several actors out of the final version, but Leto luckily remained in the film. Al\u00e9m da Linha Vermelha (1998) was nominated for seven Oscars and was a moderate success at the box office. Leto's fame had just begun. He had supporting roles in both James Mangold's Garota, Interrompida (1999), and in David Fincher's cult classic, Clube da Luta (1999), dealing with masculinity, commercialism, fascism and insomnia. While Edward Norton and Brad Pitt were the lead roles, Leto took a supporting role and dyed his hair blond. The film remains hailed by many, but at the time, Leto was already pushing himself further into controversial films. He played a supporting role of \"Paul Allen\" in the infamous Psicopata Americano (2000), starring Christian Bale, and he played the lead role in Darren Aronofsky's R\u00e9quiem para um Sonho (2000), which had Leto take grueling measures to prepare for his role as a heroin addict trying to put his plans to reality and escape the hell he is in. Both films were massive successes, if controversially received.The 2000s brought up new film opportunities for Leto. He reunited with David Fincher in O Quarto do P\u00e2nico (2002), which was another success for Leto, as well as Oliver Stone's epic passion project, Alexandre (2004). The theatrical cut was poorly received domestically (although it recouped its budget through DVD sales and international profit), and though a Final Cut was released that much improved the film in all aspects, it continues to be frowned upon by the majority of film goers. Leto rebounded with O Senhor das Armas (2005), which starred Nicolas Cage as an arms dealer who ships weapons to war zones, with Leto playing his hapless but more moral-minded brother. The film was an astounding look at the arms industry, but was not a big financial success. Leto's flush of successes suddenly ran dry when he acted in the period piece, Os Fugitivos (2006), which had Leto playing \"Ray Fernandez\", one of the two infamous \"Lonely Hearts Killers\" in the 1940s. The film was a financial failure and only received mixed responses. Leto then underwent a massive weight gain to play \"Mark David Chapman\", infamous murderer of John Lennon, in the movie, Cap\u00edtulo 27 (2007). While Leto did a fantastic job embodying the behavior and speech patterns of Chapman, the film was a complete flop, and was a critical bomb to boot. It was during this period that Leto focused increasingly on his band, turning down such films as Clint Eastwood's World War 2 film, A Conquista da Honra (2006).In 2009, however, Leto returned to acting with Sr. Ningu\u00e9m (2009). Leto's role as \"Nemo Nobody\" required him to play the character as far aged as 118, even as he undergoes a soul-searching as to whether his life turned out the way he wanted it to. The film was mostly funded through Belgian and French financiers, and was given limited release in only certain countries. Critical response, however, has praised the film's artistry and Leto's acting.He made his directorial debut in 2012 with the documentary film Artifact (2012).Leto remains the lead vocalist, multi-instrumentalist and main songwriter for Thirty Seconds to Mars. Their debut album, 30 Seconds to Mars (2002), was released to positive reviews but only to limited success. The band achieved worldwide fame with the release of their second album A Beautiful Lie (2005). Their following releases, This Is War (2009) and Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams (2013), received further critical and commercial success.After a five years hiatus from filming, Leto returned to act in the drama Dallas Buyers Club (2013), directed by Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e and co-starring Matthew McConaughey. Leto portrayed Rayon, a drug-addicted transgender woman with AIDS who befriends McConaughey's character Ron Woodroof. Leto's performance earned him an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Supporting Actor. In order to accurately portray his role, Leto lost 30 pounds, shaved his eyebrows and waxed his entire body. He stated the portrayal was grounded in his meeting transgender people while researching the role. During filming, Leto refused to break character. Dallas Buyers Club received widespread critical acclaim and became a financial success, resulting in various accolades for Leto, who was awarded the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture, Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role and a variety of film critics' circle awards for the role.In 2016, he played the Joker in the super villain film Esquadr\u00e3o Suicida (2016).Leto is considered to be a method actor, known for his constant devotion to and research of his roles. He often remains completely in character for the duration of the shooting schedules of his films, even to the point of adversely affecting his health.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Bob Stage and Pedro Borges\n          \n\n", "realName": "Jared Joseph Bryant", "height": "175"},

Her father had Irish and Norwegian ancestry, and her mother was from a Jewish immigrant family. Jennifer grew up in Brooklyn Heights, just across the Brooklyn Bridge from Manhattan, except for the four years her parents spent in Woodstock, New York. Back in Brooklyn Heights, she attended St. Ann's school. A close friend of the family was an advertising executive. When Jennifer was ten, he suggested that her parents take her to a modeling audition. She began appearing in newspaper and magazine ads (among them \"Seventeen\" magazine), and soon moved on to television commercials. A casting director saw her and introduced her to Sergio Leone, who was seeking a young girl to dance in his gangster epic Era uma Vez na Am\u00e9rica (1984). Although having little screen time, the few minutes she was on-screen were enough to reveal her talent. Her next role after that was an episode of the British horror anthology TV series Tales of the Unexpected (1979) in 1984.After Leone's movie, horror master Dario Argento signed her to play her first starring role in his thriller Phenomena (1985). The film made a lot of money in Europe but, unfortunately, was heavily cut for American distribution. Around the same time, she appeared in the rock video \"I Drove All Night,\" a Roy Orbison song, co-starring Jason Priestley. She released a single called \"Monologue of Love\" in Japan in the mid-1980s, in which she sings in Japanese a charming little song with semi-classical instruments arrangement. On the B-side is \"Message Of Love,\" which is an interview with music in background. She also appeared in television commercials in Japan.She enrolled at Yale, and then transferred two years later to Stanford. She trained in classical theater and improvisation, studying with the late drama coach Roy London, Howard Fine, and Harold Guskin.The late 1980s saw her starring in a hit and three lesser seen films. Amongst the latter was her roles in Etoile (1989), as a ballerina and in Essas Garotas (1988), where she played a self-absorbed college freshman. The hit was Labirinto, a Magia do Tempo (1986), released in 1986. Jennifer got the job after a nationwide talent search for the lead in this fantasy directed by Jim Henson and produced by George Lucas. Her career entered in a calm phase after those films, until Dennis Hopper, who was impressed after having seen her in \"Some Girls\", cast Jennifer as an ing\u00e9nue small-town girl in Um Local Muito Quente (1990), based upon the 1950s crime novel \"Hell Hath No Fury\". It received mixed critical reviews, but it was not a box office success.Rocketeer (1991), an ambitious Touchstone super-production, came to the rescue. The film was an old-fashioned adventure flick about a man capable of flying with rockets on his back. Critics saw in \"Rocketeer\" a top-quality movie, a homage to those old films of the 1930s in which the likes of Errol Flynn starred. After \"Rocketeer,\" Jennifer made Construindo uma Carreira (1991), O Cora\u00e7\u00e3o da Justi\u00e7a (1992), O Pre\u00e7o da Trai\u00e7\u00e3o (1996), her first collaboration with Nick Nolte and C\u00edrculo de Paix\u00f5es (1997). In 1998, she was invited by director Alex Proyas to make Cidade das Sombras (1998), a strange, visually stunning science-fiction extravaganza. In this movie, Jennifer played the main character's wife, and she delivered an acclaimed performance. The film itself didn't break any box-office record but received positive reviews. This led Jennifer to a contract with Fox for the television series The $treet (2000), a main part in the memorable and dramatic love-story Amor Maior que a Vida (2000) and, more important, a breakthrough part in the polemic and applauded independent R\u00e9quiem para um Sonho (2000), a tale about the haunting lives of drug addicts and the subsequent process of decadence and destruction. In \"Requiem for a Dream,\" Jennifer had her career's most courageous, difficult part, a performance that earned her a Spirit Award Nomination. She followed this role with Pollock (2000), in which she played Pollock's mistress, Ruth Klingman. In 2001, Ron Howard chose her to co-star with Russell Crowe in Uma Mente Brilhante (2001), the film that tells the true story of John Nash, a man who suffered from mental illness but eventually beats this and wins the Nobel Prize in 1994. Jennifer played Nash's wife and won a Golden Globe, BAFTA, AFI and Oscar as Best Supporting Actress. Connelly continued her career with films including Hulk (2003), her second collaboration with Nick Nolte, \u00c1gua Negra (2005), Diamante de Sangue (2006), O Dia em que a Terra Parou (2008), Ele N\u00e3o Est\u00e1 T\u00e3o a Fim de Voc\u00ea (2009) and No\u00e9 (2014), where she did her second collaboration with both Darren Aronofsky and Russell Crowe and made her third collaboration with Nick Nolte in that same film.Jennifer lives in New York. She is 5'7\", and speaks fluent Italian and French. She enjoys physical activities such as swimming, gymnastics, and bike riding. She is also an outdoors person -- camping, hiking and walking, and is interested in quantum physics and philosophy. She likes horses, Pearl Jam, SoundGarden, Jesus Jones, and occasionally wears a small picture of the The Dalai Lama on a necklace. Her favorite colors are cobalt blue, forest green, and \"very pale green/gray -- sort of like the color of the sea\". She likes to draw.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Jean Bergeron\n          \n\n", "realName": "Jennifer Lynn Connelly", "height": "169"},

		{"id": 358, "artistName": "Keir Dullea", "birthPlace": "Cleveland, Ohio, USA", "birthDate": "1936-05-30", "deathDate": null, "pictureurl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczODgxNDU1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzQxOTI2._V1_.jpg", "bio": "\n\n              Tall, slim, remote and boyishly handsome, one of Keir Dullea's most arresting features is his pale blue eyes, which featured in a number of watershed films of the 1960s. His major breakthrough (providing him legendary status) was the starring role as astronaut Dave Bowman in Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. After that, he persevered quite well on T.V. and (especially) the stage in a career now surpassing five decades.Dullea, who was born in Cleveland, Ohio, is the son of two book-store owners, and he was raised in New York's Greenwich Village section. He graduated from George School in Pennsylvania and attended both Rutgers and San Francisco State before deciding to pursue summer stock and regional theatre. Attending the Neighborhood Playhouse, he made his New York City acting debut in a production of \"Sticks and Bones\" in 1956. His first big break came with the pilot program of the Route 66 (1960) series, and he proceeded to find other TV roles in Cidade Nua (1958), Checkmate (1960) and various dramatic programs.Following stage work in \"Season of Choice\" (1959) and \"A Short Happy Life\" (1961), Dullea made an auspicious film debut in a leading role with Almas Redimidas (1961), playing a troubled street gang member who crosses paths with Don Murray's determined minister. The young actor's characters from then on seemed to walk a dangerous tight-rope of emotions, and his apparent versatility at such a young age led him to a number of other psychologically scarred portrayals. Tending to play men younger than he really was, none were more disturbed than his haphephobic adolescent David (Dullea was twenty-six at the time) in the deeply felt love story David e Lisa (1962). Paired beautifully with Janet Margolin's schizophrenic Lisa, Dullea won the Golden Globe Award for \"Most Promising Male Newcomer.\"In the World War II military drama Her\u00f3is para a Eternidade (1964)he played an edgy, nervous-eyed private who is pushed to his murderous brink by a brutal sergeant on Guadacanal. In Bunny Lake Desapareceu (1965) Dullea portrayed the incestuous brother of Carol Lynley, who may or may not figure into the disappearance of Lynley's child. Keir also costarred as the mysterious intruder who inserts an emotional wedge between gay lovers Anne Heywood and Sandy Dennis in the ground-breaking film about homosexuals, Apenas uma Mulher (1967).Topping that off, Dullea played the salacious Marquis De Sade himself in a relatively tame, internationally flavored production of O Insaci\u00e1vel Marqu\u00eas de Sade (1969). The apex of his film career, however, came with his lead role in Stanley Kubrick's epic science-fiction film, 2001: Uma Odiss\u00e9ia no Espa\u00e7o (1968), as the astronaut Dr. David Bowman.In the realm of stage acting, Keir made his debut on Broadway in 1967 with \"Dr. Cook's Garden\" costarring Burl Ives, and Dullea won some \"flower power\" stardom two years later as a sensitive young blind man who attempted to wriggle free of his protective, overbearing mother. His character also pursues love with a free-spirited girl, played by Blythe Danner, in the play \"Butterflies Are Free.\" By the time the movie of this story was released in 1972 both stars had been replaced by Goldie Hawn and Edward Albert.Dullea next went abroad to seek film work in England and in Canada, but with lukewarm results. He continued to show his odd-man-out appeal on the Broadway stage as \"Brick\" in 1970, and in the Broadway revival of \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" in 1974, acting along with Elizabeth Ashley as \"Maggie,\" and in the black comedy \"P.S. Your Cat Is Dead!\" one year later.In the years since then, Dullea has acted steadily on the stage in New York City, and in U.S. regional theatres, in productions of \"Sweet Prince,\" \"The Seagull\" and \"The Little Foxes,\"among others. His cinematic roles since 1970 have included another \"mysterious stranger\" in A Pr\u00f3xima Dimens\u00e3o (1984), and he also reprised his \"David Bowman\" role in 2010: O Ano em que Faremos Contato (1984), the sequel to \"2001: A Space Odyssey.\" Dullea has had four wives: his first was actress Margot Bennett, and he and his third wife, Susie Fuller (whom he met during the British performances of \"Butterflies are Free\" in London), cofounded the Theater Artists Workshop of Westport in 1983. Dullea, Fuller and her two children resided in London for quite a while. After Fuller's death in 1998, Dullea married for the fourth time in 1999 to actress Mia Dillon, who is best known for portraying the character \"Babe\" in in the play, \"Crimes of the Heart\" in New York City. Just a few weeks later they appeared together in the play \"Deathtrap.\"Dullea has worked infrequently in television roles. Among his more recent work in movies has been the role of a senator in O Bom Pastor (2006), along with Matt Damon and Angelina Jolie, which was directed by Robert De Niro.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Gary Brumburgh / gr-home@pacbell.net\n          \n\n", "realName": "Keir Atwood Dullea", "height": "185"},

She was the daughter of Joseph Novak, a former teacher turned transit clerk and his wife, Blanche Kral Novak, also a former teacher. Throughout elementary and high school, Kim did not get along well with teachers. She even admitted that she didn't like being told what to do and when to do it. Her first job, while in high school, was modeling teen fashions for a local department store. Kim, an avid painter, won a scholarship to the Art Institute of Chicago, but ended up going to Wright Junior College instead. While on a break from school, Kim and two of her classmates decided to go to Los Angeles and stand in line to be an extra in a movie called Um Romance em Paris (1953). An agent took notice of Kim's striking beauty arranged for a screen test with Columbia Pictures, and Kim was signed to a contract. After taking some acting lessons, Kim made her film debut in the detective drama A Morte Espera no 322 (1954) with Fred MacMurray, followed by the comedy Abaixo o Div\u00f3rcio (1954) with Jack Lemmon and Judy Holliday. These two films set the tone for her career, and she was so poised that most people had no idea she was only 21. As a result, the studio continued to pair Kim with fatherly older actors. Kim received a Golden Globe nomination for \"Most Promising Newcomer\" in 1955, and had big parts in three films released that year, first appearing as \"Kay Greylek\" in No Mau Caminho (1955). Her next role was in the controversial Otto Preminger film O Homem do Bra\u00e7o de Ouro (1955), which was a big hit. Then came F\u00e9rias de Amor (1955), Kim's breakthrough film. Kim did a superb job of acting in the film as did her costars, and now fans were eager to see more of this bright and beautiful new star. In 1957, Kim played \"Linda English\" in the hit movie Meus Dois Carinhos (1957) with Frank Sinatra and Rita Hayworth. The film did well at the box-office, but was condemned by the critics. Kim really didn't seem that interested in the role. She even said she couldn't stand people such as her character. In 1958, Kim appeared in the Alfred Hitchcock film Um Corpo que Cai (1958), which, though poorly received at the time of its release, is now considered a classic. The film was one in which a retired detective, played by James Stewart, follows a suicidal blonde (Kim), only to find out Kim was only masquerading as that person and is actually a brunette shop girl who duped him as part of an elaborate murder scheme. Kim's other film that year, the supernatural comedy Sortil\u00e9gio do Amor (1958), was a modest success, but her follow-up, Crep\u00fasculo de uma Paix\u00e3o (1959), was not in spite of drawing good reviews.Unfortunately, the hype that Columbia generated for Kim never materialized, and her career began to fade in the early 1960s as the studio system came to an end. She was being overpowered by the rise of new stars or stars that were remodeling their status within the film community. Kim said she didn't have it in herself to audition for good roles, so she took the best of what she was offered. She starred in the ensemble romantic drama O Nono Mandamento (1960), which moderately successful. With a few more nondescript films between 1960 and 1964, she landed the role of \"Mildred Rogers\" in the remake of Servid\u00e3o Humana (1964) opposite Laurence Harvey. The film debuted to mostly negative reviews and was not a success. Later that same year, she co-starred in the Billy Wilder sex satire Beija-me, Idiota (1964) with Dean Martin, but the film drew intensely hostile reviews and condemned by many civic groups, causing its studio to distance itself from the film. In 1965, Kim played the title role in the comedy As Aventuras Escandalosas de uma Ruiva (1965), and married her co-star, Richard Johnson. The marriage only lasted 14 months, but they remained friends. Kim stepped away from the cameras for a while, returning in 1968 to star in A Lenda de Lylah Clare (1968). The film only had a limited release and was a resounding flop. Though only 35, Kim said she basically didn't see herself as having a career after that. Following O Grande Roubo do Banco (1969), Kim took another four-year hiatus until 1973, when she was seen in a television film called A Terceira Garota da Esquerda (1973), a romantic drama, and appeared in a segment of the British horror anthology film Terror e Loucura (1973). Kim's next appearances on the screen were a leading role in the television film O Tri\u00e2ngulo do Diabo (1975) and a cameo in the Charles Bronson western O Grande B\u00fafalo Branco (1977). Kim ended the 1970s by appearing in Apenas um Gigol\u00f4 (1978) with David Bowie. The film was a critical and commercial failure.Opening the 1980s, Kim gained some attention for the mystery/thriller A Maldi\u00e7\u00e3o do Espelho (1980), but it did nothing for her career. For the rest of the decade, Kim was out of movies and only had a few television gigs. In 1983, Kim appeared in the ensemble TV movie, Malibu - Sonho de Ver\u00e3o (1983). She had a cameo role in the pilot episode of the short-lived Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1985) redux in 1985. From 1986 to 1987, Kim played the mysterious \"Kit Marlowe\" in 19 episodes of the TV series Falcon Crest (1981). In 1990, Kim starred in The Children (1990), and gave a great performance opposite Ben Kingsley. However, the film had a very limited release. Kim's last film to date was 1991's Liebestraum - Atra\u00e7\u00e3o Proibida (1991), in which she played a terminally ill woman with a past. The film was a major disappointment in every aspect. Making it was an especially unhappy experience for Kim, who clashed with director Mike Figgis over how to play her character. Kim hasn't acted since then, and admittedly never reached her potential. Although she has regrets about her career, she has ruled out any plans for a comeback. Kim says she just isn't cut for a Hollywood life.Fortunately, Kim's personal life has been the contrary to her career. Since 1976, Kim has been happily married to Robert Malloy, a veterinarian who shares her passion for animals and nature. Kim and her husband live on a ranch in Oregon where they raise llamas and horses, and frequently go canoeing. Kim is also an accomplished artist who expresses herself in oil paintings and sculptures.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Denny Jackson\n          \n\n", "realName": "Marilyn Pauline Novak", "height": "168"},

She was born in New York City on Halloween Day 1922, the daughter of noted theatrical and industrial designer Norman Bel Geddes, who staged more than 200 plays. After growing up amidst the theatre, Bel Geddes began acting on stage at age 18 and soon moved on to Broadway. The silver screen also beckoned; she made her film debut in Noite Eterna (1947). She was quickly labeled a star, gracing the cover of Life magazine on April 12, 1948. Her third motion picture, A Vida de um Sonho (1948), garnered Bel Geddes an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actress. Other notable films include P\u00e2nico nas Ruas (1950) directed by Elia Kazan; Alfred Hitchcock's classic mystery-thriller Um Corpo que Cai (1958) with James Stewart and Kim Novak; and A L\u00e1grima que Faltou (1959) opposite Danny Kaye. Though she achieved immediate success in films, Bel Geddes also continued to tread the boards on Broadway, since theatre was her first love. In 1952, she received the prestigious Woman of the Year Award from Hasty Pudding Theatricals USA, America's oldest theater company. She was nominated for Tony Awards as best dramatic actress for Cat on a Hot Tin Roof in 1956 and for the lead in Mary, Mary in 1961. Bel Geddes made several TV appearances on Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1955) and other programs in the mid 1950s, but her greatest television role came as Miss Ellie Ewing Farlow on Dallas (1978), which enjoyed a run of 13 years (1978-1991). She won the Emmy Award for best actress in 1980 and was nominated in the same category in 1979 and 1981. Bel Geddes left the show for health reasons during the 1984-85 season, with Donna Reed taking over the role of Miss Ellie. Bel Geddes returned for the 1985-86 season and continued on Dallas (1978) until 1990, when she effectively retired from acting. She did not appear in either of the two Dallas TV reunion movies.

The two-time Golden Globe-winner rose to fame as a cast member of the Fox sketch comedy In Living Color (1990) but leading roles in Ace Ventura: Um Detetive Diferente (1994), Debi & L\u00f3ide: Dois Idiotas em Apuros (1994) and O M\u00e1skara (1994) established him as a bankable comedy actor.James Eugene Carrey was born on January 17, 1962 in Newmarket, Ontario, Canada, and is the youngest of four children of Kathleen (Oram), a homemaker, and Percy Carrey, an accountant and jazz musician. The family surname was originally \"Carr\u00e9\", and he has French-Canadian, Scottish, and Irish ancestry. Carrey was an incurable extrovert from day one. As a child, he performed constantly, for anyone who would watch, and even mailed his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to The Carol Burnett Show (1967) at age 10. In junior high, he was granted a few precious minutes at the end of each school day to do stand-up routines for his classmates (provided, of course, that he kept a lid on it the rest of the day).Carrey's early adolescence took a turn for the tragic, however, when the family was forced to relocate from their cozy town of Newmarket to Scarborough (a Toronto suburb). They all took security and janitorial jobs in the Titan Wheels factory, Jim working 8-hour shifts after school let out (not surprisingly, his grades and morale both suffered). When they finally deserted the factory, the family lived out of a Volkswagen camper van until they could return to Toronto.Carrey made his stand-up debut in Toronto after his parents and siblings got back on their feet. He made his (reportedly awful) professional stand-up debut at Yuk-Yuk's, one of the many local clubs that would serve as his training ground in the years to come. He dropped out of high school, worked on his celebrity impersonations (among them Michael Landon and James Stewart), and in 1979 worked up the nerve to move to Los Angeles. He finessed his way into a regular gig at The Comedy Store, where he impressed Rodney Dangerfield so much that the veteran comic signed him as an opening act for an entire season. During this period Carrey met and married waitress Melissa Womer, with whom he had a daughter (Jane). The couple would later go through a very messy divorce, freeing Carrey up for a brief second marriage to actress Lauren Holly. Wary of falling into the lounge act lifestyle, Carrey began to look around for other performance outlets. He landed a part as a novice cartoonist in the short-lived sitcom The Duck Factory (1984); while the show fell flat, the experience gave Carrey the confidence to pursue acting more vigorously.Carrey also worked on breaking into film around this time. He scored the male lead in the ill-received Lauren Hutton vehicle Procura-se Rapaz Virgem (1985), and had a supporting role in Peggy Sue, seu Passado a Espera (1986), before making a modest splash with his appearance as the alien Wiploc in Meu Amante \u00e9 de Outro Mundo (1988). Impressed with Carrey's lunacy, fellow extraterrestrial Damon Wayans made a call to his brother, Keenen Ivory Wayans, who was in the process of putting together the sketch comedy show In Living Color (1990). Carrey joined the cast and quickly made a name for himself with outrageous acts (one of his most popular characters, psychotic Fire Marshall Bill, was attacked by watchdog groups for dispensing ill- advised safety tips).Following his time on In Living Color (1990), Carrey's transformation from TV goofball to marquee headliner happened within the course of a single year. He opened 1994 with a starring turn in Ace Ventura: Um Detetive Diferente (1994), a film that cashed in on his extremely physical brand of humor (the character's trademark was talking out his derri\u00e8re). Next up was the manic superhero movie O M\u00e1skara (1994), which had audiences wondering just how far Carrey's features could stretch.Finally, in December 1994, he hit theaters as a loveable dolt in the Farrelly brothers' Debi & L\u00f3ide: Dois Idiotas em Apuros (1994) (his first multi-million dollar payday). Now a box-office staple, Carrey brought his manic antics onto the set of Batman Eternamente (1995), replacing Robin Williams as The Riddler. He also filmed the follow-up to his breakthrough, Ace Ventura 2: Um Maluco na \u00c1frica (1995), and inked a deal with Sony to star in O Pentelho (1996) (replacing Chris Farley) for a cool $20 million--at the time, that was the biggest up-front sum that had been offered to any comic actor. The movie turned out to be a disappointment, both critically and financially, but Carrey bounced back the next year with the energetic hit O Mentiroso (1997). Worried that his comic shtick would soon wear thin, Carrey decided to change course.In 1998, he traded in the megabucks and silly grins to star in Peter Weir's O Show de Truman: O Show da Vida (1998) playing a naive salesman who discovers that his entire life is the subject of a TV show, Carrey demonstrated an uncharacteristic sincerity that took moviegoers by surprise. He won a Golden Globe for the performance, and fans anticipated an Oscar nomination as well--when it didn't materialize, Carrey lashed out at Academy members for their narrow-minded selection process. Perhaps inspired by the snub, Carrey threw himself into his next role with abandon. After edging out a handful of other hopefuls (including Edward Norton) to play eccentric funnyman Andy Kaufman in O Mundo de Andy (1999), Carrey disappeared into the role, living as Kaufman -- and his blustery alter-ego Tony Clifton -- for months (Carrey even owned Kaufman's bongo drums, which he'd used during his audition for director Milos Forman). His sometimes uncanny impersonation was rewarded with another Golden Globe, but once again the Academy kept quiet.An indignant Carrey next reprised his bankable mania for the Farrelly brothers in Eu, Eu Mesmo e Irene (2000), playing a state trooper whose Jekyll and Hyde personalities both fall in love with the same woman (Ren\u00e9e Zellweger). Carrey's real-life persona wound up falling for her too--a few months after the film wrapped, the pair announced they were officially a couple. By then, Carrey had already slipped into a furry green suit to play the stingy antihero of Ron Howard's O Grinch (2000).Although Carrey maintains a foothold in the comedy world with films such as Todo Poderoso (2003) and Os Pinguins do Papai (2011), he is also capable of turning in nuanced dramatic performances, as demonstrated in films like Brilho Eterno de uma Mente sem Lembran\u00e7as (2004) and the drama/comedy Sim Senhor (2008). In 2013, he costars with Steve Carell in O Incr\u00edvel M\u00e1gico Burt Wonderstone (2013).Carrey has one child with his first wife, Melissa Carrey, whom he divorced in 1995. He married actress Lauren Holly in 1996, but they split less than a year later.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Kage Fuusha and Anonymous\n          \n\n", "realName": "James Eugene Carrey", "height": "188"},

The British actress has made a point of eschewing straightforward pretty-girl parts in favor of more devilish damsels; as a result, she's built an eclectic resume that runs the gamut from Shakespearean tragedy to modern-day mysticism and erotica.Kate Elizabeth Winslet was born in Reading, Berkshire, into a family of thespians -- parents Roger Winslet and Sally Anne Bridges-Winslet were both stage actors, maternal grandparents Oliver and Linda Bridges ran the Reading Repertory Theatre, and uncle Robert Bridges was a fixture in London's West End theatre district. Kate came into her talent at an early age. She scored her first professional gig at eleven, dancing opposite the Honey Monster in a commercial for a kids' cereal. She started acting lessons around the same time, which led to formal training at a performing arts high school. Over the next few years, she appeared on stage regularly and landed a few bit parts in sitcoms. Her first big break came at age 17, when she was cast as an obsessive adolescent in Almas G\u00eameas (1994). The film, based on the true story of two fantasy-gripped girls who commit a brutal murder, received modest distribution but was roundly praised by critics.Still a relative unknown, Winslet attended a cattle call audition the next year for Ang Lee's Raz\u00e3o e Sensibilidade (1995). She made an immediate impression on the film's star, Emma Thompson, and beat out more than a hundred other hopefuls for the part of plucky Marianne Dashwood. Her efforts were rewarded with both a British Academy Award and an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Winslet followed up with two more period pieces, playing the rebellious heroine in Paix\u00e3o Proibida (1996) and Ophelia in Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet (1996).The role that transformed Winslet from art house attraction to international star was Rose DeWitt Bukater, the passionate, rosy-cheeked aristocrat in James Cameron's Titanic (1997). Young girls the world over both idolized and identified with Winslet, swooning over all that face time opposite heartthrob Leonardo DiCaprio and noting her refreshingly healthy, unemaciated physique. Winslet's performance also garnered a Best Actress nomination, making her the youngest actress to ever receive two Academy Award nominations.After the swell of unexpected attention surrounding Titanic (1997), Winslet was eager to retreat into independent projects. Rumor has it that she turned down the lead roles in both Shakespeare Apaixonado (1998) and Anna e o Rei (1999) in order to play adventurous soul searchers in O Expresso de Marrakesh (1998) and Fogo Sagrado! (1999). The former cast her as a young single mother traveling through 1970s Morocco with her daughters in tow; the latter, as a zealous follower of a guru tricked into a \"deprogramming\" session in the Australian outback. The next year found her back in period dress as the Marquis de Sade's chambermaid and accomplice in Contos Proibidos do Marqu\u00eas de Sade (2000). Kate holds the distinction of being the youngest actor ever honored with four Academy Award nominations (she received her fourth at age 29). As of 2016, she has been nominated for an Oscar seven times, winning one of them: she received the Best Actress Oscar for the drama O Leitor (2008), playing a former concentration camp guard.For her performance of Joanna Hoffman in Steve Jobs (2015), she received her seventh Academy Award nomination.Off camera, Winslet is known for her mischievous pranks and familial devotion. She has two sisters, Anna Winslet and Beth Winslet (both actresses), and a brother, Joss.In 1998, she married assistant director Jim Threapleton. They had a daughter, Mia Honey Threapleton, in October 2000. They divorced in 2001. She later married director Sam Mendes in 2003 and gave birth to their son, Joe Alfie Winslet-Mendes, later that year. After seven years of marriage, in February 2010 they announced that they had amicably separated, and divorced in October 2010. In 2012, Kate married Ned Rocknroll, with whom she has a son. She was awarded Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 2012 Queen's Birthday Honours List for her services to drama.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            IMDb Editors\n          \n\n", "realName": "Kate Elizabeth Winslet", "height": "169"},

He also made a lot of commercials for Gap, Smirnoff, Air France, Nike, Coca Cola, Adidas, Polaroid and Levi - the latter making him the most highly-awarded director for a one-off commercial.Hollywood became interested in Gondry's success and he directed his first feature movie Natureza Quase Humana (2001), adapting a Charlie Kaufman's scenario, which was shown in the 2001 Cannes Festival. Although it wasn't a big success, this film allowed him to direct Brilho Eterno de uma Mente sem Lembran\u00e7as (2004), for which he again collaborated with Charlie Kaufman. The movie became a popular independent film and he and his co-writers won an Oscar for it.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Raph JULLIEN\n          \n\n", "realName": null, "height": "178"},

In 1931, he graduated from the Todd School in Woodstock, Illinois. He turned down college offers for a sketching tour of Ireland. He tried unsuccessfully to enter the London and Broadway stages, traveling some more in Morocco and Spain.Recommendations by Thornton Wilder and Alexander Woollcott got him into Katharine Cornell's road company, with which he made his New York debut as Tybalt in 1934. The same year, he married, directed his first short, and appeared on radio for the first time. He began working with John Houseman and formed the Mercury Theatre with him in 1937.In 1938, they produced \"The Mercury Theatre on the Air\", famous for its broadcast version of \"The War of the Worlds\" (intended as a Halloween prank). His first film to be seen by the public was Cidad\u00e3o Kane (1941), a commercial failure losing RKO $150,000, but regarded by many as the best film ever made. Many of his subsequent films were commercial failures and he exiled himself to Europe in 1948.In 1956, he directed A Marca da Maldade (1958); it failed in the United States but won a prize at the 1958 Brussels World's Fair. In 1975, in spite of all his box-office failures, he received the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award, and in 1984, the Directors Guild of America awarded him its highest honor, the D.W.

He was the eldest of three sons born to Sally Whitworth (Willson) and Joseph Cheshire Cotten, Sr., an assistant postmaster.Jo (as he was known) and his brothers Whit and Sam spent their summers at their aunt and uncle's home at Virginia Beach. And there and at an early age he discovered a passion for story-telling, reciting, and performing acts for his family. Cotten studied acting at the Hickman School of Expression in Washington, D.C. and worked as an advertising agent afterward. But by 1924 tried to enter acting in New York. His money opportunities were limited to shipping clerk, and after a year of attempting stage work, he left with friends, heading for Miami. There he found a variety of jobs: lifeguard, salesman, a stint as entrepreneur -- making and selling 'Tip Top Potato Salad' - but more significantly, drama critic for the Miami Herald. That evidently led to appearance in plays at the Miami Civic Theater. Through a connection at the Miami Herald he managed to land an assistant stage manager job in New York. In 1929 he was engaged for a season at the Copley Theatre in Boston, and there he was able to expand his acting experience, appearing in 30 plays in a wide variety of parts. By 1930 he made his Broadway debut. In 1931 Cotten married Lenore LaMont (usually known as Kipp), a pianist, divorced with a four-year-old daughter.To augment his income as an actor in the mid-30s, Cotten took on radio shows in addition to his theatre work. At one audition he met an ambitious, budding actor/writer/director/producer with a mission to make his name-Orson Welles. Cotten was 10 years his senior, but the two found a kindred spirit in one another. For Cotten, Welles association would completely redirect his serious acting life. Their early co-acting attempts boded ill for employment in formal acting vehicles. At a rehearsal for CBS radio the two destroyed a scene taking place on a rubber tree plantation. One or the other was supposed to say the line: \"Barrels and barrels of pith....\" They could not overcome uncontrolled laughter at each attempt. The director berated them as acting like 'school-children' and 'unprofessional', and thereafter both were considered unreliable. Welles's ambition put that quickly behind them when he formed The Mercury Theatre Players. Coming on board were later Hollywood stalwarts: Everett Sloane, Agnes Moorehead, Ruth Warrick, and Ray Collins. In 1937, Cotten starred in Welles's Mercury productions of \"Julius Caesar\" and \"Shoemaker's Holiday\". And he made his film debut in the Welles-directed short Too Much Johnson (1938), a comedy based on William Gillette's 1890 play. The short was occasionally screened before or after Mercury productions, but never received an official release. Cotten returned to Broadway in 1939, starring as C.K. Dexter Haven in the original production of Philip Barry's \"The Philadelphia Story\". The uproar over Welles's \"War of the Worlds\" radio broadcast, was rewarded with an impressive contract from RKO Pictures. The two-picture deal promised full creative control for the young director, and Welles brought his Mercury players on-board in feature roles in what he chose to bring to the screen. But after a year, nothing had germinated until Welles met with writer Herman J. Mankiewicz, resulting in the Cidad\u00e3o Kane (1941) idea - early 1940. The story of a slightly veiled William Randolph Hearst with Welles as Kane and Cotten, in his Hollywood debut, as his college friend turned confidant and theater critic, Jed Leland, would become film history, but at the time it caused little more than a ripple. Hearst owned the majority of the country's press outlets and so forbade advertisements for the film. The film was nominated for nine Academy Awards in 1942 but was largely ignored by the Academy, only winning for Best Screenplay for Welles and Mankiewicz.The following year Cotten and Welles collaborated again in Soberba (1942), acclaimed but again ignored at Oscar time, and the next year's Nazi thriller Jornada do Pavor (1943). Cotten, along with some Welles ideas, wrote the screenplay. Welles with his notorious overrunning of budgeting was duly dropped by RKO thereafter. Later in 1943 Cotten's exposure and acquaintance with young producer David O. Selznick resulted in a movie contract and the launching of his mainstream and very successful movie career as a romantic leading man. Thereafter he appeared with some of the most leading of Hollywood leading ladies - a favorite being Jennifer Jones, Selznick's wife with the two of them being his most intimate friends. Cotten got the opportunity to play a good range of roles through the 1940s - the darkest being the blue beard-like killer in Alfred Hitchcock thriller A Sombra de uma D\u00favida (1943) with Teresa Wright. Perhaps the most fun was Ambiciosa (1947) with a vivacious Loretta Young. Cotten starred with Jennifer Jones in four films: the wartime domestic drama Desde Que Partiste (1944), the romantic drama Um Amor em Cada Vida (1945), the western Duelo ao Sol (1946), and later in the critically acclaimed O Retrato de Jennie (1948), from the haunting Robert Nathan book. Cotten is thoroughly convincing as a second-rate, unmotivated artist who finds inspiration from a chance acquaintance budding into love with an incarnation of a girl who died years before. Welles and Cotten did not work again until O 3\u00ba Homem (1949), directed by Carol Reed. For Cotten, the role as the hapless boyhood friend and second-rate novel writer Holly Martins would be a defining moment in a part both comedic and bittersweet, its range making it one of his best performances. Unfortunately, he was again overlooked for an Oscar.Cotten was kept in relative demand into his mature acting years. Into the 1950s, he reunited with \"Shadow Of A Doubt\" co star Thereas Wright, to do the memorable bank caper \"The Steel Trap\"(1952).He co stared with Jean Peters in \"Blueprint For A Murder\"(1953). For the most part, the movie roles were becoming more B than A. He had a brief role as a member of the Roman Senate, reuniting with lifelong friend Welles in his Otelo (1951). There were a few film-noir outings along with the usual fare of the older actor with fewer roles. However, he was much more successful in returning to theater roles in the new television playhouse format. He also did some episodic TV and some series ventures, as with On Trial, which was later called The Joseph Cotten Show. He had a memorable role in an Alfred Hitchcock Presents, \"Breakdown\", where he was a man in a lone and isolated car accident, trapped and unable to speak. He voices over and shows his great acting skill simply through facial expressions. His one last stint with Welles was uncredited and sort of Jed Leland-revisited as the hokey coroner early in Welles's over-the-top A Marca da Maldade (1958). Of his association with Welles, Cotten said: \"Exasperating, yes. Sometimes eruptive, unreasonable, ferocious, yes. Eloquent, penetrating, exciting, and always - never failingly even at the sacrifice of accuracy and at times his own vanity - witty. Never, never, never dull.\"With the passing of his first wife in 1960 Cotten met and married British actress Patricia Medina. The 1960s found him equally busy in TV and film. He made the circuit of the most popular detective and cowboy series of the period. By 1964 he returned to film with the money making old-Hollywood-dame- horror-movie genre hit Com a Maldade na Alma (1964) with other vintage Hollywood legends Bette Davis, Olivia de Havilland, and Agnes Moorehead. His other films of that decade were of the quick entertainment variety along with some foreign productions, and TV movies. There were also more TV series and guests appearances, especially The Ed Sullivan Show, a popular stop during its long run. In the 1970s Cotten was still in demand-for even more of the curiosity-appeal of the populace for an older star. Along with the new assortment of TV series, he anchored himself at Universal with small parts in forgettable movies, the sluggish Universal epic dud Tora! Tora! Tora! for instance, and the steady diet of TV series being cranked out there. Though older actors have laughed in public about their descent into cheap horror movies, one can only wonder at the impetus to do them -- by such greats, as Claude Rains -- besides a can't-pass-up alluring salary.Cotten did the campy O Abomin\u00e1vel Dr. Phibes (1971) with Vincent Price and about that time two second rate Italian horror outings where he was Baron Blood and Baron Frankenstein. Then again there was better exposure in the Universal minor sci-fi classic No Mundo de 2020 (1973). And in yet another Universal sequel, where the profit-logic was to gather a cast of veterans from the Hollywood spectrum in any situation spelling disaster and watch the ticket sales skyrocket, Cotten joined the all-star cast of Aeroporto 77 (1977). He rounded out the decade with the ever faddish Fantasy Island and more Universal TV rounds. This contributor met and worked with Joseph Cotten during this latter evolution of one of Hollywood's greats. He wore his own double-breasted blue blazer and tan slacks in several roles - no need for wardrobe. His pride and joy was a blue 1939 Jaguar SS, something of a fixture on the Universal lot.Cotten was not ready to turn his back on Hollywood until the beginning of the 1980s when he managed to appear in the epic flop Portal do Para\u00edso (1980). After a Love Boat episode (1981), Cotten joined his wife and his love of gardening and entertaining friends in retirement. He also had the time to write an engaging autobiography Vanity Will Get You Somewhere (1987). Cotten's somewhat matter-of-fact and seemingly gruff acting voice served him well. Certainly his command of varied roles deserved more than the snub of never being nominated for an Academy Award. He was not the only actor to suffer being underrated, but that is largely forgotten in those memorable roles that speak for him. And for what it is worth, the Europeans had the very good sense to award him the Venice Film Festival Award for Best Actor for Portrait of Jennie, one of his favorite roles.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Volker Boehm & MO and William McPeak\n          \n\n", "realName": "Joseph Cheshire Cotten", "height": "188"},

It was an extraordinary performance, justifiably praised by critics and public alike. She was apparently slated to be on the short list for an Academy Award. However, there was to be no stardom in films for this talented actress.Dorothy was discovered by Charles Chaplin while performing with the Carmel Little Theater in Monterey County. He was enchanted by her and his praise won her a Hollywood contract. That contract was unaccountably dropped after just three months without even a screen test. At Warner Brothers, she was utilised purely for publicity stills and as a clothes model. She would have none of it. Having already acquired a reputation as a firebrand, she walked out on the studio, having been relegated to what amounted to nothing more than a crowd scene. She was determined to be appreciated for her acting ability, not to be wasted as an extra. Columbia signed her on. However, between 1938 and 1940, most of her roles (in which she was often billed as 'Linda Winters') still turned out to be uncredited bits and walk-ons. There were also westerns and 'Three Stooges' comedy shorts, but certainly nothing of substance. Her turning point came courtesy of an introduction to Orson Welles at a party. Welles came to think of her as ideal casting for the part of brash, feather-brained would-be diva Susan Alexander Kane. A successful screen test followed and then came the role that brought Dorothy Comingore at once fame and ruin.Soon after its release, the wrath of Citizen Hearst descended upon everyone associated with the picture. In particular, he never forgave Dorothy for playing a part so obviously (and effectively) modelled on his mistress. Dorothy Comingore was already well known for her leftist sympathies. Her father had been a high profile unionist and her first husband had died fighting Franco's fascists in the Spanish Civil War. The newspaper magnate had ample ammunition to orchestrate a nationwide smear campaign, using prominent columnists Hedda Hopper and Walter Winchell to branding her a 'subversive', a member of the Communist Party. Though devoid of substantiating evidence, the spurious allegation stuck. Dorothy had associations and friends in Hollywood (not to mention her husband, the screenwriter Richard Collins, who had been an active party member of the Hollywood chapter in the 1930's), who had communist affiliations or were party members. She had also made enemies by following in her father's footsteps, canvassing for and supporting civil rights causes and union solidarity. Refusing to cooperate with the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) made her an 'unfriendly witness'. Not only was she blacklisted in Hollywood, but her phone was tapped, her mail opened and her home ransacked. Collins, by now Dorothy's ex, did not have the same moral fortitude. To escape blacklisting, he recanted his previous testimony and fully cooperated with HUAC's inquisitors.Dorothy's career effectively ended in 1951, her acting swansong in films being a small part in an indifferent drama of teenage angst, Noite Inolvid\u00e1vel (1951). Her personal life, meanwhile, continued to spiral out of control. She became an alcoholic. In October 1952, she was arrested by vice squad officers on a solicitation charge, another likely frame-up as payback for her \"red\" affiliations. Having lost custody of her children, she agreed to have the charges against her dropped in exchange for being committed to the Camarillo State Mental Hospital. There she spent two years (not 'a little time', as she had promised in court) 'undergoing treatment'. Not much is known of her final years, except, that she spent most of it in seclusion, married to a postman in Connecticut in a home with two dogs and ten cats. She died in December 1971 of pulmonary disease, likely the result of long-term alcohol abuse, at the age of 58.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            I.S.Mowis\n          \n\n", "realName": "Margaret Louise Comingore", "height": "163"},

Aged three, she sang 'The Lord is my Shepherd' on a public stage and seven years later joined the St. Louis Municipal Opera as a dancer and singer for four years. In keeping with her father's dictum of finishing her education first (then being permitted to do whatever she wished with her career), Agnes attended Muskingum College (Ohio), and, subsequently, the University of Wisconsin. She graduated with an M.A. in English and public speaking and later added a doctorate in literature from Bradley University to her resume. When her family moved to Reedsburg, Wisconsin, where her father had a pastorate, Agnes taught public school English and drama for five years. In between, she went to Paris to study pantomime with Marcel Marceau.In 1928, she began training at the American Academy for Dramatic Arts and graduated with honors the following year. In order to supplement her income , Agnes had turned to radio early on. She had her first job in 1923 as a singer for a St. Louis radio station. Her love for that medium remained with her all her life. From the 1930s to the 50s, she appeared on numerous serials, dramas and children's programs. She was Min Gump in \"The Gumps\" (1934), the 'dragon lady' in \"Terry and the Pirates\" (1937), Margot Lane of classic comic strip fame in \"The Shadow\", Mrs.Danvers in \"Rebecca\" and the bed-ridden woman about to meet her end in \"Sorry, Wrong Number\". Acting on the airwaves was so important to her that she would insist on its continuation as a precondition of a later contract with MGM. Significantly, through her radio work on \"The Shadow\"and \"March of Time\" in 1937, she met and befriended fellow actor Orson Welles. Welles soon invited her to join him and Joseph Cotten as charter members of his Mercury Theatre on the Air. Agnes was involved in the famous \"War of the Worlds\" broadcast of 1938 which attracted nationwide attention and resulted in a lucrative $100,000 per picture deal with RKO in Hollywood. The Mercury players (the other principals were Ray Collins, Everett Sloane, Paul Stewart and George Coulouris) packed up and went west.An ebullient and versatile character actress, Agnes was impossible to typecast: she could play years older than her age, appear as heroine or villainess, tragedienne or comedienne. In her first film, the iconic Cidad\u00e3o Kane (1941), she played the titular character's mother. She received her greatest critical acclaim for her emotive second screen performance as Aunt Fanny Minafer in Soberba (1942). In addition to being voted the year's best female performer by the New York Film Critics she was also nominated for an Academy Award. Through the years, Agnes would be nominated three more times: for her touching portrayal of the jaded but sympathetic Baroness Conti in Mrs. Parkington, a Mulher Inspira\u00e7\u00e3o (1944); for her role as the title character's Aunt Aggie in Belinda (1948) and for playing Velma, the hard-boiled, suspicious housekeeper of Bette Davis in Com a Maldade na Alma (1964), co-starring her old friend Joseph Cotten. Other notable film appearances included Jane Eyre (1943), with Orson Welles, A Mulher de Branco (1948) as Countess Fusco), Recorda\u00e7\u00f5es (1947) (as a 105-year old woman) and Prisioneiro do Passado (1947), a classic film noir in which she had third billing behind Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall as the treacherous , malevolent Madge Rapf. She had a rare starring role in the campy horror flick Nas Garras do Morcego (1959), giving (according to the New York Times of December 17) 'a good, snappy performance'.On Broadway, she appeared in such acclaimed plays as \"All the King's Men\" and \"Candlelight\". She enjoyed success with \"Don Juan in Hell\", touring nationally: the first time (1951-2) with Charles Laughton and Cedric Hardwicke, the second time (though receiving fewer critical plaudits) with Ricardo Montalban and Paul Henreid in 1973. She also starred with Joseph Cotten in \"Prescription Murder\" (1962). While not a great critical success, this was much liked by audiences and it introduced a famous detective named Lieutenant Columbo. From 1954, she also toured the U.S. and Europe with her own a one-woman show entitled \"The Fabulous Redhead\". Agnes performed numerous times on television before landing the role of Endora on A Feiticeira (1964). One particularly interesting part came her way through the director Douglas Heyes who remembered her from \"Sorry, Wrong Number\". He cast her in the starring - and indeed, only role in Al\u00e9m da Imagina\u00e7\u00e3o: The Invaders (1961). As the lonely old woman confronted by tiny alien invaders in her remote farmhouse, Agnes never utters a single word and cleverly acts her scenes as a pantomime of unspoken terror.Of course, the genial Agnes Moorehead has been immortalized as Elizabeth Montgomery's flamboyant witch-mother, Endora, although that was not a role the actress wished to be remembered for (in spite of several Emmy Award nominations). Indeed, she had thought this whole witchcraft theme to be rather far-fetched and was somewhat taken aback by the show's huge popularity. Agnes had a special clause inserted in her contract which limited her appearances to eight out of twelve episodes which gave her the opportunity to also work on other projects. Commenting on the acting profession in one of her many interviews (New York Times, May 1, 1974), she found the key to success in being \" sincere in your work \" and to \"just go right on whether audiences or critics are taking your scalp off or not\".\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            I.S.Mowis\n          \n\n", "realName": "Agnes Robertson Moorehead", "height": "163"},

He received the Jury's and Producers' Awards at the International Student Film Fest in Munich and won the 1st Prize at the Tel Aviv Film Fest. Popular success followed with his breakthrough short fiction film, Drengen der gik bagl\u00e6ns (1995), about a boy, who - after the death of his brother - discovers he can turn back time by walking backwards. This poetic short film was followed the reckless and fast-paced thriller, The Biggest Heroes (1996).Vinterberg is one of the founding \"brothers\" of dogme95, a set of rules dedicated to reintroducing the element of risk in filmmaking. Festa de Fam\u00edlia (1998) was not only his first Dogme95 project it was also his first international success. With this movie he \"penetrated a layer of evil and abomination [he'd] never been to before\" (according to an interview by Bo Green Jensen for Weekend Avisen). The story revolves around Family patriarch Helge Klingenfeldt Hansen, celebrating his 60eth birthday. In a speech the eldest son addresses his father, supposedly to honor him, only to reveal the father's darkest secret. Among other international prizes, Vinterberg received the Prix du Jury of the Cannes International Film Festival.His feature, Dogma do Amor (2003), is a departure from the dogme95 project. It is the story of John (Joaquin Phoenix) and Elena (Claire Danes), whose marriage has fallen apart. Their troubled relationship is reflected in their surroundings as Vinterberg attempts to create a parallel between the chaos of the world and the chaos inside the characters.Back in his homeland, Thomas Vinterberg nevertheless sticks to the English language. His Querida Wendy (2005), written by Lars von Trier, is a fierce attack against America's obsession with weapons. In 2007, Vinterberg returns to Danish with Quando um Homem Volta para Casa (2007) whose subject (a singer comes home to the town he left behind) is appropriate to the circumstances. Vinterberg strikes hard with his next two works, Submarino (2010), the gloomy story of two brothers who try to cope with their depressing everyday lives and A Ca\u00e7a (2012), the shocking tale of a man who falls prey to a madding crowd. It will surprise nobody that Thomas Vinterberg's next project is a new adaptation of Thomas Hardy's 'Far from the Madding Crowd (2014)'.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Rikke Lauritsen/rikke@lycos.com/Guy Bellinger\n          \n\n", "realName": null, "height": "183"},

He is of Italian descent and has two older sisters. He studied at the Actors Studio and the American Stanislavski Theatre. Vincent D'Onofrio is known as an \"actor's actor\". The wide variety of roles he has played and the quality of his work have earned him a reputation as a versatile talent.His first paid role was in Off-Broadway's \"This Property Is Condemned\". He continued appearing in plays and worked as a bouncer, a bodyguard and a delivery man. In 1984, he made his Broadway debut in \"Open Admissions\", followed by work in numerous other stage plays. In 2012, D'Onofrio returned to teach at the Lee Strasberg Theater & Film Institute. As a film actor, D'Onofrio's career break came when he played a mentally unbalanced recruit in Nascido para Matar (1987), directed by the renowned Stanley Kubrick. For this role D'Onofrio gained nearly 70 pounds. He had a major role in Tudo por Amor (1991), and appeared prominently in the box-office smash MIB: Homens de Preto (1997) as the bad guy (Edgar \"The Bug\").Other films of note in which he has appeared are Tr\u00eas Mulheres, Tr\u00eas Amores (1988), JFK: A Pergunta que N\u00e3o Quer Calar (1991), O Jogador (1992), Ed Wood (1994), A Cela (2000), Separados pelo Casamento (2006) and Jurassic World: O Mundo dos Dinossauros (2015).

Robert Goren, the lead character in the TV series Lei & Ordem: Crimes Premeditados (2001). Goren is based on Sherlock Holmes but, instead of relying upon physical evidence like Holmes, D'Onofrio's character focuses on psychology to identify the perpetrators, whom he often draws into confessing or yielding condemning evidence.

His early years in Bristol would have been an ordinary lower-middle-class childhood, except for one extraordinary event. At age nine, he came home from school one day and was told his mother had gone off to a seaside resort. However, the real truth was that she had been placed in a mental institution, where she would remain for years, and he was never told about it (he would not see his mother again until he was in his late 20s).He left school at age 14, lying about his age and forging his father's signature on a letter to join Bob Pender's troupe of knockabout comedians. He learned pantomime as well as acrobatics as he toured with the Pender troupe in the English provinces, picked up a Cockney accent in the music halls in London, and then in July 1920, was one of the eight Pender boys selected to go to the United States. Their show on Broadway, \"Good Times\", ran for 456 performances, giving Grant time to acclimatize. He would stay in America. Mae West wanted Grant for Uma Loira para Tr\u00eas (1933) because she saw his combination of virility, sexuality and the aura and bearing of a gentleman. Grant was young enough to begin the new career of fatherhood when he stopped making movies at age 62.One biographer said Grant was alienated by the new realism in the film industry. In the 1950s and early 1960s, he had invented a man-of-the-world persona and a style - \"high comedy with polished words\". In Ladr\u00e3o de Casaca (1955), he and Grace Kelly were allowed to improvise some of the dialogue. They knew what the director, Alfred Hitchcock, wanted to do with a scene, they rehearsed it, put in some clever double entendres that got past the censors, and then the scene was filmed. His biggest box-office success was another Hitchcock 1950s film, Intriga Internacional (1959) made with Eva Marie Saint since Kelly was by that time Princess of Monaco.Although Grant retired from the screen, he remained active. He accepted a position on the board of directors at Faberge. By all accounts this position was not honorary, as some had assumed. Grant regularly attended meetings and traveled internationally to support them. The position also permitted use of a private plane, which Grant could use to fly to see his daughter wherever her mother Dyan Cannon, was working. He later joined the boards of Hollywood Park, the Academy of Magical Arts (The Magic Castle - Hollywood, California), Western Airlines (acquired by Delta Airlines in 1987) and MGM.Grant expressed no interest in making a career comeback. He was in good health until almost the end of his life, when he suffered a mild stroke in October 1984. In his last years, he undertook tours of the United States in a one-man-show, \"A Conversation with Cary Grant\", in which he would show clips from his films and answer audience questions. On November 29, 1986, Cary Grant died at age 82 of a cerebral hemorrhage in Davenport, Iowa.In 1999, the American Film Institute named Grant the second male star of Golden Age of Hollywood cinema (after Humphrey Bogart). Grant was known for comedic and dramatic roles; his best-known films include Levada da Breca (1938), N\u00fapcias de Esc\u00e2ndalo (1940), Jejum de Amor (1940), Este Mundo \u00e9 um Hosp\u00edcio (1944), Interl\u00fadio (1946), Tarde Demais para Esquecer (1957), Intriga Internacional (1959) and Charada (1963).\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Dale O'Connor <daleoc@worldnet.att.net>\n          \n\n", "realName": "Archibald Alec Leach", "height": "187"},

He was born in Yorkshire, and attended Marlborough and Cambridge, where he discovered acting on a lark, and abandoned a planned career as an architect. Following work in stock companies, he joined the Old Vic under the guidance of Sir Tyrone Guthrie and of Alexander Korda, who gave Mason at least one small film role in 1933, but fired him a few days into shooting. Mason remained in the theatre becoming a prominent stage actor, meanwhile getting first small, then rapidly larger roles in \"quota quickies\", minor films made to accommodate laws mandating a certain percentage of films shown in Britain to be British-made. Mason's talent for playing protagonists of a decidedly hard-bitten or melancholy stripe brought him from these minor films to a position as one of Britain's major film stars of the 1940s. When, late in that decade, he came to America, he played somewhat more glamorous or heroic roles than he had been accustomed to in Britain, but he remained a dynamic and intelligent force on the screen. His tendency to take any job offered led him to have many unworthy credits on his resume but, throughout his career, he remained a respected and powerful figure in the industry. His mellifluous voice and an uncanny ability to suggest rampant emotion beneath a face of absolute calm made him a fascinating performer to watch.

His father was an alcoholic. Malcolm hated his parents' ways. His father was keen to send his son to private school to give him a good start in life, so Malcolm was packed off to boarding school at age 11. He attended the Tunbridge Boarding School and the Cannock House School in Eltham, Kent. At school, he was beaten with the slipper or cane every Monday for his wayward behavior. Whilst at school, he decided that he wanted to become an actor; it was also around this time that his love for race cars began. He attended the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts (LAMDA) to study acting. Meanwhile, he worked at his parents' pub but lost his job when the pub went bankrupt, his father drinking all the profits. He then had a variety of jobs, from coffee salesman to messenger.His first big-screen role was in A L\u00e1grima Secreta (1967), although his two-minute scene was ultimately cut from the completed film. Soon after, he caught the attention of director Lindsay Anderson who cast him in the role of a rebellious student in his film Se... (1968). The film catapulted Malcolm to stardom in Britain but failed everywhere else. He was so enthusiastic about the film's success that he wanted to do another right away. He began writing what would become the semi-autobiographical Um Homem de Sorte (1973). Then he starred as Alex DeLarge in Stanley Kubrick's controversial Laranja Mec\u00e2nica (1971), a role that gave him world fame, and legendary status (although typecasting him as a in villainous roles). In early 1976, he spent nearly a year working on what would later be one of the most infamous films of all time, the semi-pornographic Cal\u00edgula (1979), financed by Penthouse magazine founder Bob Guccione. Around that time, the British film industry collapsed, forcing him to flee to America to continue working. His first American film was Um S\u00e9culo em 43 Minutos (1979). He then did Hospital dos Malucos (1982), the last part of Lindsay Anderson's working-class trilogy that started with Se... (1968).In the mid-1980s, the years of alcohol and drug abuse, including $1000 a week on cocaine, caught up with him. Years of abuse took its toll on him; his black hairs were now gray. Looking older than he really was, nobody wanted to cast him for playing younger roles. The big roles having dried up, he did many B-rated movies. The 1990s were kinder to him, though. In 1994, he was cast as Dr. Tolian Soran, the man who killed Captain James T. Kirk in Jornada nas Estrelas: Generations (1994). He was back on the track, playing villains again. He played another in the classic BBC miniseries Our Friends in the North (1996). Today, with more than 100 films under his belt, he is one of the greatest actors in America. He still does not have American citizenship, but he likes the no-nonsense American ways.

For more than two and a half decades he had toiled in a wide variety of supporting roles before finding international success as the often crude, irascible, heavy-drinking Superintendant Andy Dalziel in TV's Dalziel and Pascoe (1996). When the series began, Clarke had summed up Dalziel as 'a beer-swilling chauvinist pig', but the character evolved and became more complex and endearing (in a curmudgeonly sort of way) over the show's eleven-year duration. There were also commonalities between the actor and his creation: impatience, a reputation for not tolerating fools gladly; a humorous, irreverent nature and a shared dislike for political correctness. In private life, Clarke was passionate about football (a lifelong Manchester City supporter) and golf.The son of a hard-working stained glass maker, Clarke developed his love for the performing arts while in his teens. A frequent visitor to the cinema for Saturday morning and matin\u00e9e screenings (\"Flash Gordon\" seemed to have been a particular favourite), he was actively encouraged by his parents to follow his chosen vocation. He performed in amateur theatrics, meanwhile earning his money as a copy boy, running errands for the Manchester Evening News, then working in a fruit and vegetable market before securing his first acting gig with Huddersfield Rep at the age of eighteen. Clarke once recalled his first performance, as an elderly German academic, which was marred by a make-up malfunction when the self-raising flour he had put in his hair to make it appear white mixed with perspiration, turned to dough and ran down his face. He would eventually master the stage (enacting, among other parts, Caligula in John Mortimer's 1972 adaptation of \"I, Claudius\" and Winston Churchill in \"Three Days in May\" at the West End, a performance the reviewer of The Guardian described as \"utterly persuasive\").From the late 1960's, Clarke found more or less regular television work, at first with Granada in series like Os Vingadores (1961) and Callan (1967). For years he remained a struggling actor, earning barely enough to make ends meet. He performed on stage at the Royal Court in London, and, to improve his situation, earned a second income as a van driver. He finally attracted attention on the big screen as a violent, bowler-hatted thug in Stanley Kubrick's Laranja Mec\u00e2nica (1971). The turning point in Clarke's career was his role as a pig-headed manager of an engineering firm involved in a chalk-and-cheese relationship with a liberal-minded academic in Nice Work (1989). In the years between, his expressive features graced a succession of diverse leading and supporting parts in both comedy and drama: Churchill in ITV's Jennie: Lady Randolph Churchill (1974); Quasimodo in the 1976 television version of \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\"; a mutinous Roman soldier in the epic miniseries Masada (1981); a surly East German STASI officer in the uproarious parody Top Secret!: Superconfidencial (1984); a pig-fixated Regency period industrialist in Blackadder the Third (1987); stalwart, bewhiskered Lawrence Boythorne in BBC's outstanding production of Bleak House (2005); \"pathetically nice\" market gardener Brian Addis in the first two seasons of Down to Earth (2000). Clarke's guest appearances were prolific: from Elsie Tanner's nephew in Coronation Street (1960) to a querulous diabetic patient in Chame a Parteira (2012).Always a welcome presence in period drama, he had been cast in Poldark - Her\u00f3i de Guerra (2015), a remake of the popular 1975 miniseries, based on the novels by Winston Graham. Filming had already begun in Bristol and Cornwall when Clarke died in his sleep at the age of 67.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            I.S.Mowis\n          \n\n", "realName": "Alan James Clarke", "height": "185"},

He was a Diver on the British National Diving Team and finished twelfth in the World Championships in 1992. He has also been a fashion model, black market salesman and finally of course, actor. He received the audition for his debut role as Bacon in Jogos, Trapa\u00e7as e Dois Canos Fumegantes (1998) through French Connection, for whom he was modeling. They became a major investor in the film and introduced Jason to Guy Ritchie, who invited him to audition for a part in the film by challenging him to impersonate an illegal street vendor and convince him to purchase fake jewelry. Jason must have been doing something right because after the success of Jogos, Trapa\u00e7as e Dois Canos Fumegantes (1998) he teamed up again with Guy Ritchie for Snatch: Porcos e Diamantes (2000), with co-stars including Brad Pitt, Dennis Farina and Benicio Del Toro. After Snatch: Porcos e Diamantes (2000) came Febre Urbana (2000) with US music star Ja Rule, followed by a supporting actor role in the sci-fi film Fantasmas de Marte (2001), Jet Li's O Confronto (2001) and another screen partnership with Vinnie Jones in Penalidade M\u00e1xima (2001) under Guy Ritchie's and Matthew Vaughn's SKA Films. Finally in 2002 he was cast as the lead role of Frank Martin in Carga Explosiva (2002). Jason was also in the summer 2003 blockbuster remake of Um Golpe \u00e0 Italiana (1969), Uma Sa\u00edda de Mestre (2003), playing Handsome Rob.Throughout the 2000s, Statham became a star of juicy action B-films, most significantly Adrenalina (2006) and Adrenalina 2 (2009), and also Rogue, o Assassino (2007), opposite Jet Li, and Efeito Domin\u00f3 (2008) and Corrida Mortal (2008), among others. In the 2010s, his reputation for cheeky and tough leading performances led to his casting as Lee Christmas in Os Mercen\u00e1rios (2010) and its sequels, the comedy A Espi\u00e3 Que Sabia de Menos (2015), and as (apparently) reformed villain Deckard Shaw in Velozes & Furiosos 6 (2013), Velozes & Furiosos 7 (2015), Velozes & Furiosos 8 (2017), and Velozes & Furiosos: Hobbs & Shaw (2019). Apart from these blockbusters, he continued headlining B-films such as Linha de Frente (2013).In 2017, he had his first child, a son with his partner, model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Mikedavies86\n          \n\n", "realName": null, "height": "178"},

A favorite of film buffs, Del Toro gained mainstream public attention as the conflicted but basically honest Mexican policeman in Steven Soderbergh's Traffic: Ningu\u00e9m Sai Limpo (2000).Benicio was born on February 19, 1967 in San Germ\u00e1n, Puerto Rico, the son of lawyer parents Fausta Genoveva Sanchez Rivera and Gustavo Adolfo Del Toro Bermudez. His mother died when he was young, and his father moved the family to a farm in Pennsylvania. A basketball player with an interest in acting, he decided to follow the family way and study business at the University of California in San Diego. A class in acting resulted in his being bitten by the acting bug, and he subsequently dropped out and began studying with legendary acting teacher Stella Adler in Los Angeles and at the Circle in the Square Acting School in New York City. Telling his parents that he was taking courses in business, Del Toro hid his new studies from his family for a little while.During the late 1980s, he made several television appearances, most notably in an episode of Miami Vice (1984) and in the NBC miniseries A Guerra das Drogas (1990). Del Toro's big-screen career got off to a slower start, however--his first role was Duke the Dog-Faced Boy in Pee-Wee: Meu Filme Circense (1988). However, things looked better when he landed the role of Dario, the vicious henchman in the James Bond film 007 - Permiss\u00e3o para Matar (1989). Surprising his co-stars at age 21, Del Toro was the youngest actor ever to portray a Bond villain. However, the potential break was spoiled as the picture turned out to be one of the most disappointing Bond films ever; this was lost amid bigger summer competition.Benicio gave creditable performances in many overlooked films for the next several years, such as Unidos Pelo Sangue (1991), Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o Colombo: A Aventura do Descobrimento (1992) and Dinheiro, pra que Dinheiro? (1993). His roles in Sem Medo de Viver (1993) and A Lua dos Amantes (1994) gained him more critical notices, and 1995 proved to be the first \"Year of Benicio\" as he gave a memorable performance in O Pre\u00e7o da Ambi\u00e7\u00e3o (1994) before taking critics and film buffs by storm as the mumbling, mysterious gangster in Os Suspeitos (1995), directed by Bryan Singer. Del Toro won an Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Actor for the role in the Oscar-winning film.Staying true to his independent roots, he next gave a charismatic turn as cold-blooded gangster Gaspare Spoglia in Os Chef\u00f5es (1996) directed by Abel Ferrara. He also appeared as Benny Dalmau in Basquiat - Tra\u00e7os de Uma Vida (1996), directed by artist friend Julian Schnabel. That year also marked his first truly commercial film, as he played cocky Spanish baseball star Juan Primo in Estranha Obsess\u00e3o (1996), which starred Robert De Niro. Del Toro took his first leading man role in Excesso de Bagagem (1997), starring and produced by Alicia Silverstone. Hand-picked by Silverstone, Del Toro's performance was pretty much the only thing critics praised about the film, and showed the level of consciousness he was beginning to have in the minds of film fans.He took a leading role with his good friend Johnny Depp in Medo e Del\u00edrio (1998), co-written and directed by the legendary Terry Gilliam. Gaining 40 pounds for the role of Dr. Gonzo, the drug-addicted lawyer to sportswriter Raoul Duke, Benicio immersed himself totally in the role. Using his method acting training so far as to burn himself with cigarettes for a scene, this was a trying time for Del Toro. The harsh critical reviews proved tough on him, as he felt he had given his all for the role and been dismissed. Many saw the crazed, psychotic performance as a confirmation of the rumors and overall weirdness that people seemed to place on Del Toro.Taking a short break after the ordeal, 2000 proved to be the second \"Year of Benicio\". He first appeared in \u00c0 Sangue Frio (2000), directed by friend and writer Christopher McQuarrie. Then he went to work for actor's director Steven Soderbergh in Traffic: Ningu\u00e9m Sai Limpo (2000). A complex and graphic film, this nonetheless became a widespread success and Oscar winner. His role as conflicted Mexican policeman Javier Rodriguez functions as the movie's real heart amid an all-star ensemble cast, and many praised this as the year's best performance, a sentiment validated by a Screen Actor's Guild Award for \"Best Actor\". He also gave a notable performance in Snatch: Porcos e Diamantes (2000) directed by Guy Ritchie, which was released several weeks later, and A Promessa (2001) directed by Sean Penn. Possessing sleepy good looks reminiscent of James Dean or Marlon Brando, Del Toro has often jokingly been referred to as the \"Spanish Brad Pitt\".With his newfound celebrity, Del Toro has become a sort of heartthrob, being voted one of People magazine's \"50 Most Beautiful People\" as well as \"Most Eligible Bachelors.\" A favorite of film fans for years for his diverse and \"cool guy\" gangster roles, he has become a mainstream favorite, respected for his acting skills and choices. So far very careful in his projects and who he works with, Del Toro can boast an impressive resume of films alongside some of the most influential and talented people in the film business.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Brian Stewart\n          \n\n", "realName": "Benicio Monserrate Rafael Del Toro Sanchez", "height": "188"},

After watching Butch Cassidy (1969) as a child, Guy realized that what he wanted to do was make films. He never attended film school, saying that the work of film school graduates was boring and unwatchable. At 15 years old, he dropped out of school and in 1995, got a job as a runner, ultimately starting his film career. He quickly progressed and was directing music promos for bands and commercials by 1995.The profits that he made from directing these promos was invested into writing and making the film The Hard Case (1995), a 20-minute short film that is also the prequel to his debut feature Jogos, Trapa\u00e7as e Dois Canos Fumegantes (1998). Sting's wife, Trudie Styler, saw The Hard Case (1995) and invested in the feature film. Once completed, 10 British distributors turned the film down before it eventually was released in the UK in 1998 and in the US in 1999; the film put Ritchie on the map as one of the hottest rising filmmakers of the time, and launched the careers of actors Jason Statham, Jason Flemyng, and Vinnie Jones, among others.Jogos, Trapa\u00e7as e Dois Canos Fumegantes (1998) was followed by Snatch: Porcos e Diamantes (2000), this time with a bigger budget and a few more familiar faces such as Brad Pitt, Dennis Farina, Benicio Del Toro alongside returning actors Jason Statham, Vinnie Jones and Jason Flemyng. At the end of 2000, Ritchie married the pop superstar Madonna in Scotland, and proceeded to work with his famous wife on a variety of film and video projects, including the short Star (2001), made for BMW and co-starring Clive Owen, and the controversial video \"What It Feels Like for a Girl,\" which was called out for its violence. In 2002, the couple embarked on a remake of the 1974 Lina Wertm\u00fcller film Destino Ins\u00f3lito (2002); the new film was a critical and commercial flop, winning five Razzie Awards. Ritchie followed up with the Vegas heist film Rev\u00f3lver (2005), which was panned, but won favor with the crime thriller Rock'n'Rolla: A Grande Roubada (2008), which featured a game, energetic cast and brought American attention to rising stars Gerard Butler and Tom Hardy.The next year saw the release of Sherlock Holmes (2009), starring Robert Downey Jr. in the title role and Jude Law as his cohort Dr. Watson. The film received mostly good reviews but, more important for Ritchie's career, was a solid blockbuster hit that grossed more than $520 million dollars worldwide and spawned a sequel, Sherlock Holmes: O Jogo de Sombras (2011). Ritchie is tentatively scheduled to direct an adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island.Ritchie has two sons with Madonna: Rocco, born in 2000, and an adopted son, David, born in 2005. In late 2008, the couple confirmed reports that they were splitting up, and agreed to a divorce settlement that was finalized in December of that year. In September 2011, Ritchie's girlfriend, model Jacqui Ainsley, gave birth to a son, Rafael, and in July 2012 the couple announced they were expecting their second child.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            mikedavies86\n          \n\n", "realName": "Guy Stuart Ritchie", "height": "180"},

On the stage by four, Jackie was touring at the age of five with his family in Los Angeles, California.While performing on the stage, he was spotted by Charles Chaplin, who then and there planned a movie in which he and Jackie would star. To test Jackie, Chaplin first gave him a small part in Um Dia Bem Passado (1919), which proved that he had a screen presence. The movie that Chaplin planned that day was O Garoto (1921), where the Tramp would raise Jackie and then lose him. The movie was very successful and Jackie would play a child in a number of movies and tour with his father on the stage.By 1923, when he made Daddy (1923), he was one of the highest paid stars in Hollywood. He would leave First National for MGM where they put him into Long Live the King (1923). By 1927, at the age of 13, Coogan had grown up on the screen and his career was starting to go through a downturn. His popular film career would end with the classic tales of Aventuras de Tom Sawyer (1930) and Mocidade Feliz (1931).In 1935, his father died and his mother married Arthur Bernstein, who was his business manager. When he wanted the money that he made as a child star in the 1920s, his mother and stepfather refused his request and Jackie filed suit for the approximately $4 million that he had made. Under California law at the time, he had no rights to the money he made as a child, and he was awarded only $126,000 in 1939. Because of the public uproar, the California Legislature passed the Child Actors Bill, also known as the Coogan Act, which would set up a trust fund for any child actor and protect his earnings.In 1937, Jackie married Betty Grable and the marriage lasted for three years. During World War II, he would serve in the army and return to Hollywood after the war. Unable to restart his career, he worked in B-movies, mostly in bit parts and usually playing the heavy. It was in the 1950s that he started appearing on television and he acted in as many shows as he could. By the 1960s, he would be in two completely different television series, but both were comedies. The first one was McKeever and the Colonel (1962), where he played Sgt. Barnes in a military school from 1962 to 1963. The second series was the classic A Fam\u00edlia Addams (1964), where he played Uncle Fester opposite Gomez and Morticia from 1964 to 1966. After that, he would continue making appearances on a number of television shows and a handful of movies. He died of a heart attack in 1984.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Tony Fontana <tony.fontana@spacebbs.com>\n          \n\n", "realName": "John Leslie Coogan", "height": "170"},

He was increasingly drawn towards acting, and made his screen debut while still in his teens, joining a stage company in 1923. By the late 1920s he was a successful matinee idol of the Italian theatre, and repeated that achievement in Italian movies, mostly light comedies. He turned to directing in 1940, making comedies in a similar vein, but with his fifth film A Culpa dos Pais (1944), he revealed hitherto unsuspected depths and an extraordinarily sensitive touch with actors, especially children. It was also the first film he made with the writer Cesare Zavattini with whom he would subsequently make V\u00edtimas da Tormenta (1946) and Ladr\u00f5es de Bicicletas (1948), heartbreaking studies of poverty in postwar Italy which won special Oscars before the foreign film category was officially established. After the box-office disaster of Umberto D. (1952), a relentlessly bleak study of the problems of old age, he returned to directing lighter work, appearing in front of the camera more frequently. Although Ontem, Hoje e Amanh\u00e3 (1963) won him another Oscar, it was generally accepted that his career as one of the great directors was over.

Thus he started directing TV commercials and video clips (such as Julien Clerc in 1984). At the same time he met designer/drawer Marc Caro with whom he made two short animation movies: L'\u00e9vasion (1978) and Le man\u00e8ge (1981), the latter winning a C\u00e9sar for the best short movie. After these two successful movies Jeunet and Caro spent more than one year together by making every detail (scenario, costumes, production design) of their third short movie: Le bunker de la derni\u00e8re rafale (1981). This movie combined sci-fi and heroic-fantasy in a visually delirious story of the rising paranoia among soldiers trapped underground. With that movie they garnered several festival prizes in France. (This movie also marked their first collaboration with Gilles Adrien who later wrote the story of their two feature movies with them). After that Jeunet directed two other short movies without the help of Caro: Pas de repos pour Billy Brakko (1984), then Foutaises (1989) with Dominique Pinon who became another regular collaborator of Jeunet. All Jeunet's short movies won a lot of awards in France but also overseas and he won a second C\u00e9sar with Foutaises (1989).In 1991, Jeunet and Caro took their first steps in a feature movie: Delicatessen (1991). It was such a success that it won 4 C\u00e9sars including the awards for the best new director(s) and the best scenario. For this movie Jeunet and Caro divided responsibilities with the former guiding the actors and the latter coordinating the artistic elements. And Jeunet showed again his liking to have Dominique Pinon, of course, but also Rufus, Jean-Claude Dreyfus and Ticky Holgado who appeared again in Jeunet's next movies, or Maurice Lamy who already had a little role in Foutaises (1989). The success of Delicatessen (1991) even surprised Jeunet and Caro themselves but they took advantage of that in order to finally make their almost 10 year-old project! This project took more than 4 more years to be carried out but the movie turned out enormous: Ladr\u00e3o de Sonhos (1995) was a black tale and was so innovative at this period that they needed to create new software for the special effects (mostly made by Pitof). Jeunet and Caro kept the same responsibilities as in Delicatessen (1991) and the movie also combined different international skills: US actor Ron Perlman, Chilean-born actor Daniel Emilfork, Iranian cinematographer Darius Khondji (who was already in the crew of Delicatessen (1991)), Americo-Italian composer Angelo Badalamenti and French fashion-designer Jean-Paul Gaultier for the costumes. While the film was supposed to be suitable for children, some considered it \"dark\", to which Jeunet and Caro replied that it was no more \"dark\" than Pin\u00f3quio (1940) or Bambi (1942).But these critics didn't stop the movie from being successful and when the movie gained them further attention, it was only a matter of time before Hollywood called them. Thus in 1997, Jeunet left France to make a temporary career in the USA for the fourth installment of the 'Alien' series: Alien, a Ressurrei\u00e7\u00e3o (1997). Marc Caro followed him just as a design supervisor but Jeunet brought with him a little army' of his usual collaborators (mostly French): actors Dominique Pinon and Ron Perlman, but also Pitof, Darius Khondji or editor Herv\u00e9 Schneid, and for the first time Alain Carsoux who was responsible of the special effects of Jeunet's next film. In 2000, after two collaborations with Caro and one in the US, Jeunet came back to France in order to make a more personal movie, even if Guillaume Laurant wrote the story with him. Thus he used a lot of different details he wrote everywhere during his life (and also recycled things he'd already done, e.g. in Foutaises (1989)) and shot his story mostly in the Parisian suburb of Montmartre where he lives. Then the result was O Fabuloso Destino de Am\u00e9lie Poulain (2001) starring Audrey Tautou and Mathieu Kassovitz. With this movie Jeunet made the biggest worldwide success of French cinema history. A real magical potion, which won innumerable awards in the whole world including 4 C\u00e9sars (therefore Jeunet won his fifth and sixth C\u00e9sars!).Jeunet eventually decided to adapt S\u00e9bastien Japrisot's book Eterno Amor (2004) for which he called Audrey Tautou and Dominique Pinon again, but also many other famous French actors and Jodie Foster. It had one of the most important budgets in French film history and eventually had a good international success and many nominations and awards.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Raph JULLIEN\n          \n\n", "realName": null, "height": null},

He came direct from the hit 1940 original Broadway production of \"Pal Joey\" and planned to return to the Broadway stage after making the one film required by his contract. His first picture for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was Id\u00edlio em Do-Re-Mi (1942) with Judy Garland. What kept Kelly in Hollywood were \"the kindred creative spirits\" he found behind the scenes at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The talent pool was especially large during World War II, when Hollywood was a refuge for many musicians and others in the performing arts of Europe who were forced to flee the Nazis. After the war, a new generation was coming of age. Those who saw Sinfonia de Paris (1951) would try to make real life as romantic as the reel life they saw portrayed in that musical, and the first time they saw Paris, they were seeing again in memory the seventeen-minute ballet sequence set to the title song written by George Gershwin and choreographed by Kelly. The sequence cost a half million dollars (U.S.) to make in 1951 dollars. Another Kelly musical of the era, Cantando na Chuva (1952), was one of the first 25 films selected by the Library of Congress for its National Film Registry. Kelly was in the same league as Fred Astaire, but instead of a top hat and tails Kelly wore work clothes that went with his masculine, athletic dance style.Gene Kelly died at age 83 of complications from two strokes on February 2, 1996 in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, California.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Dale O'Connor <daleoc@worldnet.att.net>\n          \n\n", "realName": "Eugene Curran Kelly", "height": "173"},

He later recalled that the only thing he wanted to be was a tap dancer.He was born in Columbia, South Carolina, to Helen Pauline (Cohen) and Mordecai Moses Donen, a dress-shop manager, of Russian-Jewish and German-Jewish descent. Donen debuted on Broadway at seventeen. While working as an assistant choreographer in 1941, he met and befriended the actor Gene Kelly, Kelly being the brash, extrovert and energetic side of the burgeoning partnership, Donen the more refined and relaxed. Three years later, the two men renewed their collaboration in Hollywood and did much to reinvigorate the musical genre. For the next decade, they worked side-by-side as choreographers and co-directors (a relationship Donen described as 'wonderful' but 'also trying at times'), linked to MGM's Arthur Freed unit. Between them, they directed classic musicals like Um Dia em Nova York (1949) and Cantando na Chuva (1952) and co-wrote the original story for A Bela Ditadora (1949). Freed, by the way, was the producer almost single-handedly responsible for the high standard of MGM's A-grade musicals in the 40s and 50s. A former vaudevillian and song-plugger, Freed was an astute judge of talent and encouraged gifted individuals from other media (like radio or theatre) to become involved with pictures. Moreover, he gave artists like Kelly and Donen free rein to express their creative flair.In 1949, MGM signed Donen to a seven-year contract as director in his own right. From then on, he and Kelly went their separate ways. After directing Sete Noivas para Sete Irm\u00e3os (1954), Donen moved on to Paramount for Cinderela em Paris (1957), then to Warner Brothers for Um Pijama para Dois (1957) and O Parceiro de Satan\u00e1s (1958). As musicals waned in popularity, Donen branched out into other genres. He began to direct and produce elegant, lavish romantic dramas like the delightful Indiscreta (1958), sophisticated comedies like Do Outro Lado, o Pecado (1960) and Um Caminho para Dois (1967) (which starred Donen's favorite actress, Audrey Hepburn), as well as the top-shelf thrillers Charada (1963) (the best film Alfred Hitchcock never directed, again with Hepburn) and Arabesque (1966). Arguably, his most out-of-character film from this period was the esoteric mephistophelean (and very British) farce O Diabo \u00e9 Meu S\u00f3cio (1967), featuring the irrepressible comic talents of Peter Cook and Dudley Moore.The 1970s heralded a steady decline in the quality of Donen's output. None of his later efforts seemed to have the panache of his earlier work: not the tepid adventure-comedy Os Aventureiros do Lucky Lady (1975) (despite a good cast and sumptuous production look) nor the nostalgic musical fantasy O Pequeno Pr\u00edncipe (1974), based on the book by Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry. A failure at the box office, the latter also marked the end of the Frederick Loewe-Alan Jay Lerner musical partnership. Donen's career may have finished on a low with a weak sojourn into science fiction that was Saturno 3 (1980) and the absolutely dreadful comedy Feiti\u00e7o do Rio (1984), but his reputation as one of the giants of the classic Hollywood musical is assured. Donen received an Honorary Oscar in 1998 \"\"for a body of work marked by grace, elegance, wit, and visual innovation.''\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            I.S.Mowis\n          \n\n", "realName": null, "height": "173"},

She went on to star with Bruce Willis in the highly recognized show, A Gata e o Rato (1985), and won Shepherd two Golden Globe Awards. Her third Golden Globe followed for her series, Cybill (1995), with which she also took on a producer role.Aside from the film industry, Shepherd has been an outspoken activist for issues such as gay rights and abortion rights.

Upon leaving school, he decided to become a journalist, beginning as a newspaper copy boy. Although he succeeded in becoming a reporter, he discovered the theater and made his stage debut at age 17. He served as a radioman in the Royal Navy for two years, then attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, where his classmates included Albert Finney, Alan Bates and Richard Harris.O'Toole spent several years on-stage at the Bristol Old Vic, then made an inconspicuous film debut in the Disney classic A Espada de um Bravo (1960). In 1962, he was chosen by David Lean to play T.E. Lawrence in Lean's epic drama Lawrence da Ar\u00e1bia (1962). The role made O'Toole an international superstar and received him his first Academy Award nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role.

His paternal grandfather was Irish, and the rest of his family was Mexican. After starting life in extremely modest circumstances in Mexico, his family moved to Los Angeles, where he grew up in the Boyle Heights and Echo Park neighborhoods. He attended Polytechnic High School and later Belmont High, but eventually dropped out. The young Quinn boxed (which stood him in good stead as a stage actor, when he played Stanley Kowalski in \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" to rave reviews in Chicago), then later studied architecture under Frank Lloyd Wright at the great architect's studio, Taliesin, in Arizona. Quinn was close to Wright, who encouraged him when he decided to give acting a try. After a brief apprenticeship on stage, Quinn hit Hollywood in 1936 and picked up a variety of small roles in several films at Paramount, including an Indian warrior in Jornadas Her\u00f3icas (1936), which was directed by the man who later became his father-in-law, Cecil B. DeMille.As a contract player at Paramount, Quinn mainly played villains and ethnic types, such as an Arab chieftain in the Bing Crosby-Bob Hope vehicle A Sedu\u00e7\u00e3o de Marrocos (1942). As a Mexican national (he did not become an American citizen until 1947), he was exempt from the draft. With many actors in the service fighting World War II, Quinn was able to move up into better supporting roles. He had married DeMille's daughter Katherine DeMille, which afforded him entrance to the top circles of Hollywood society. He became disenchanted with his career and did not renew his Paramount contract despite the advice of others, including his father-in-law (whom Quinn felt never accepted him due to his Mexican roots). Instead, he returned to the stage to hone his craft. His portrayal of Stanley Kowalski in \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" in Chicago and on Broadway (where he replaced the legendary Marlon Brando, who is forever associated with the role) made his reputation and boosted his film career when he returned to the movies.Brando and Elia Kazan, who directed \"Streetcar\" on Broadway and on film (Uma Rua Chamada Pecado (1951)), were crucial to Quinn's future success. Kazan, knowing the two were potential rivals due to their acclaimed portrayals of Kowalski, cast Quinn as Brando's brother in his biographical film of Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata, Viva Zapata! (1952). Quinn won the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for 1952, making him the first Mexican-American to win an Oscar. It was not to be his lone appearance in the winner's circle: he won his second Supporting Actor Oscar in 1957 for his portrayal of Paul Gauguin in Vincente Minnelli's biographical film of Vincent van Gogh, Sede de Viver (1956), opposite Kirk Douglas. Over the next decade Quinn lived in Italy and became a major figure in world cinema, as many studios shot films in Italy to take advantage of the lower costs (\"runaway production\" had battered the industry since its beginnings in the New York / New Jersey area in the 1910s). He appeared in several Italian films, giving one of his greatest performances as the circus strongman who brutalizes the sweet soul played by Giulietta Masina in her husband Federico Fellini's masterpiece A Estrada da Vida (1954).Alternating between Europe and Hollywood, Quinn built his reputation and entered the front rank of character actors and character leads. He received his third Oscar nomination (and first for Best Actor) for George Cukor's A F\u00faria da Carne (1957). He played a Greek resistance fighter against the Nazi occupation in the monster hit Os Canh\u00f5es de Navarone (1961) and received kudos for his portrayal of a once-great boxer on his way down in Rod Serling's R\u00e9quiem Para um Lutador (1962). He went back to playing ethnic roles, such as an Arab warlord in David Lean's masterpiece Lawrence da Ar\u00e1bia (1962), and he played the eponymous lead in the \"sword-and-sandal\" blockbuster Barrab\u00e1s (1961). Two years later, he reached the zenith of his career, playing Zorba the Greek in the film of the same name (a.k.a. Zorba, o Grego (1964)), which brought him his fourth, and last, Oscar nomination as Best Actor. The 1960s were kind to him: he played character leads in such major films as The Shoes of the Fisherman (1968) and O Segredo de Santa Vit\u00f3ria (1969). However, his appearance in the title role in the film adaptation of John Fowles' novel, Mago, O Falso Deus (1968), did nothing to save the film, which was one of that decade's notorious turkeys.In the 1960s, Quinn told Life magazine that he would fight against typecasting. Unfortunately, the following decade saw him slip back into playing ethnic types again, in such critical bombs as O Magnata Grego (1978). He starred as the Hispanic mayor of a southwestern city on the short-lived television series The Man and the City (1971), but his career lost its momentum during the 1970s. Aside from playing a thinly disguised Aristotle Onassis in the cinematic roman-a-clef O Magnata Grego (1978), his other major roles of the decade were as Hamza in the controversial Maom\u00e9 - O Mensageiro de Al\u00e1 (1976) (a.k.a. \"Mohammad, Messenger of God\"), as the Italian patriarch in A Heran\u00e7a dos Ferramonti (1976), yet another Arab in Caravanas (1978) and a Mexican patriarch in Os Filhos de Sanchez (1978). In 1983, he reprised his most famous role, Zorba the Greek, on Broadway in the revival of the musical \"Zorba\", for 362 performances. Though his film career slowed during the 1990s, he continued to work steadily in films and television.Quinn lived out the latter years of his life in Bristol, Rhode Island, where he spent most of his time painting and sculpting. He died in a hospital in Boston from pneumonia and respiratory failure linked to his battle with throat cancer. He was 86 years old.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Jon C.

Jack Hawkins made his London theatrical debut at age 12, playing the elf king in \"Where The Rainbow Ends\". At 17, he got the lead role of St. George in the same play. At 18, he made his debut on Broadway in \"Journey's End\". At 21, he was back in London playing a young lover in \"Autumn Crocus\". He married his leading lady, Jessica Tandy. That year he also played his first real film role in the 1931 sound version of Alfred Hitchcock's O Rei dos Vampiros (1932). During the 30s, he took his roles in plays more seriously than the films he made. In 1940, Jessica accepted a role in America and Jack volunteered to serve in the Royal Welsh Fusiliers. He spent most of his military career arranging entertainment for the British forces in India. One of the actresses who came out to India was Doreen Lawrence who became his second wife after the war. Alexander Korda advised Jack to go into films and offered him a three-year contract. In his autobiography, Jack recalled: \"Eight years later I was voted the number one box office draw of 1954. I was even credited with irresistible sex appeal, which is another quality I had not imagined I possessed.\" A late 1940s film, A Rosa Negra (1950), where he played a secondary role to Tyrone Power, would be one of his most fortunate choices of roles. The director was Henry Hathaway who Jack said was \"probably the most feared, yet respected director in America, for he had a sharp tongue and fired people at the drop of a hat. Years later, after my operation when I lost my voice, he went out of his way to help me get back into films. What I did not know was that during the filming of 'The Black Rose' he was himself suffering from cancer.\" In the 1950s came the film that made Hawkins a star, Mar Cruel (1953). Suffering from life long real life sea sickness, he played the captain of the Compass Rose. After surgery for throat cancer in 1966, requiring the removal of his larynx, Jack continued to make films. He mimed his lines and the voice was dubbed by either Charles Gray or Robert Rietty. His motto during those last years came from Milton's \"Comus\", a verse play in which he acted early in his career in Regent's Park. The lines: \"Yet where an equal poise of hope and fear does arbitrate the event, my nature is that I incline to hope, rather than to fear.\"\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Dale O'Connor <daleoc@worldnet.att.net>\n          \n\n", "realName": "John Edward Hawkins", "height": "181"},

During the 1920s, he briefly considered the possibility of becoming an accountant like his father before finding a job at Gaumont British Studios in 1927. He worked as tea boy, clapper boy, messenger, then cutting room assistant. By 1935, he had become chief editor of Gaumont British News until in 1939 when he began to edit feature films, notably for Anthony Asquith, Paul Czinner and Michael Powell. Amongst films he worked on were Pigmali\u00e3o (1938), Major Barbara (1941) and E... Um Avi\u00e3o n\u00e3o Regressou (1942).By the end of the 1930s, Lean's reputation as an editor was very well established. In 1942, No\u00ebl Coward gave Lean the chance to co-direct with him the war film Nosso Barco, Nossa Alma (1942). Shortly after, with the encouragement of Coward, Lean, cinematographer Ronald Neame and producer 'Anthony Havelock-Allan' launched a production company called Cineguild. For that firm Lean first directed adaptations of three plays by Coward: the chronicle Este Povo Alegre (1944), the humorous ghost story Uma Mulher do Outro Mundo (1945) and, most notably, the sentimental drama Desencanto (1945). Originally a box-office failure in England, \"Brief Encounter\" was presented at the very first Cannes film festival (1946), where it won almost unanimous praises as well as a Grand Prize.From Coward, Lean switched to Charles Dickens, directing two well-regarded adaptations: Grandes Esperan\u00e7as (1946) and Oliver Twist (1948). The latter, starring Alec Guinness in his first major movie role, was criticized by some, however, for potential anti-Semitic inflections. The last two films made under the Cineguild banner were A Hist\u00f3ria de uma Mulher (1949), a romance from a novel by H.G. Wells, and the true crime story As Cartas de Madeleine (1950). Neither had a significant impact on critics or audiences.The Cineguild partnership came to an end after a dispute between Lean and Neame. Lean's first post-Cineguild production was the aviation drama Sem Barreira no C\u00e9u (1952), a great box-office success in England and his most spectacular movie so far. He followed with two sophisticated comedies based on theatrical plays: Papai \u00e9 do Contra (1954) and the Anglo-American co-production Quando o Cora\u00e7\u00e3o Floresce (1955). Both were well received and \"Hobson's Choice\" won the Golden Bear at the 1954 Berlin film festival.Lean's next movie was pivotal in his career, as it was the first of those grand-scale epics he would become renowned for. A Ponte do Rio Kwai (1957) was produced by Sam Spiegel from a novel by 'Pierre Boulle', adapted by blacklisted writers Michael Wilson and Carl Foreman. Shot in Ceylon under extremely difficult conditions, the film was an international success and triumphed at the Oscars, winning seven awards, most notably best film and director.Lean and Spiegel followed with an even more ambitious film, Lawrence da Ar\u00e1bia (1962), based on \"Seven Pillars of Wisdom\", the autobiography of T.E. Lawrence. Starring relative newcomer Peter O'Toole, this film was the first collaboration between Lean and writer Robert Bolt, cinematographer Freddie Young and composer Maurice Jarre. The shooting itself took place in Spain, Morocco and Jordan over a period of 20 months. Initial reviews were mixed and the film was trimmed down shortly after its world premi\u00e8re and cut even more during a 1971 re-release. Like its predecessor, it won seven Oscars, once again including best film and director.The same team of Lean, Bolt, Young and Jarre next worked on an adaptation of Boris Pasternak's novel \"Dr. Zhivago\" for producer Carlo Ponti. Doutor Jivago (1965) was shot in Spain and Finland, standing in for revolutionary Russia and, despite divided critics, was hugely successful, as was Jarre's musical score. The film won five Oscars out of ten nominations, but the statuettes for film and director went to A Novi\u00e7a Rebelde (1965).Lean's next movie, the sentimental drama A Filha de Ryan (1970), did not reach the same heights. The original screenplay by Robert Bolt was produced by old associate Anthony Havelock-Allan, and Lean once again secured the collaboration of Freddie Young and Maurice Jarre. The shooting in Ireland lasted about a year, much longer than expected. The film won two Oscars; but, for the most part, critical reaction was tepid, sometimes downright derisive, and the general public didn't really respond to the movie.This relative lack of success seems to have inhibited Lean's creativity for a while. But towards the end of the 1970s, he started to work again with Robert Bolt on an ambitious two-part movie about the Bounty mutiny. The project fell apart and was eventually recuperated by Dino De Laurentiis. Lean was then approached by producers John Brabourne and Richard Goodwin to adapt E.M. Forster's novel \"A Passage to India\", a book Lean had been interested in for more than 20 years. For the first time in his career; Lean wrote the adaptation alone, basing himself partly on Santha Rama Rau's stage version of the book. Lean also acted as his own editor. Passagem para a \u00cdndia (1984) opened to mostly favourable reviews and performed quite well at the box-office. It was a strong Oscar contender, scoring 11 nominations. It settled for two wins, losing the trophy battle to Milos Forman's Amadeus (1984).Lean spent the last few years of his life preparing an adaptation of Joseph Conrad's meditative adventure novel \"Nostromo\". He also participated briefly in Richard Harris' restoration of \"Lawrence of Arabia\" in 1988. In 1990, Lean received the American Film Institute's Life Achievement award. He died of cancer on April 16, 1991 at age 83, shortly before the shooting of \"Nostromo\" was about to begin.Lean was known on sets for his extreme perfectionism and autocratic behavior, an attitude that sometimes alienated his cast or crew. Though his cinematic approach, classic and refined, clearly belongs to a bygone era, his films have aged rather well and his influence can still be found in movies like O Paciente Ingl\u00eas (1996) and Titanic (1997). In 1999, the British Film Institute compiled a list of the 100 favorite British films of the 20th century. Five by David Lean appeared in the top 30, three of them in the top five.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Fran\u00e7ois Leclair (qv's & corrections by A.

He grew up fishing and working on farms. His hometown of St. Matthews, Kentucky, is hardly the environment to encourage a career in the entertainment industry, though, so when asked, \"How did you get into show business?\" Beatty responds, \"By hanging out with the wrong crowd.\" That \"crowd\" includes some of the industry's most prominent names, such as John Huston, Steven Spielberg, Robert Altman, Paul Newman, Richard Burton, Charlton Heston, Marlon Brando and Robert Redford.Beatty has garnered praise from both critics and peers as a dedicated actor's actor. He started as a professional performer at age ten, when he earned pocket money singing in gospel quartets and a barber shop. The big city and bright lights did not come easy, though. The first ten years of Beatty's career were spent at the Barter Theater in Abingdon, Virginia. He then moved on to the Erie Playhouse in Pennsylvania, the Playhouse Theater in Houston, Texas, and the prestigious Arena Stage Company in Washington, D.C. He was also a member of Shakespeare in Central Park, Louisville, Kentucky. Later, he appeared in the Broadway production of \"The Great White Hope\". At the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles, he won rave reviews when he starred in \"The Accidental Death of an Anarchist\".In 1971, Beatty was chosen by director John Boorman for the role of Bobby Trippe in the hit film/backwoods nightmare Amargo Pesadelo (1972). Co-star Burt Reynolds and Beatty struck up a friendship together, and Ned has since been cast by Burt in several other films together, including Sob o Signo da Vingan\u00e7a (1973), W.W. and the Dixie Dancekings (1975), and the abysmal O Imbat\u00edvel (1983). Ned's talents were also noticed by others in Hollywood and he was cast in many key productions of the 1970s turning in stellar performance, including an Academy Award nomination of Best Supporting Actor for his role in Rede de Intrigas (1976). Beatty was also marvelous in Nashville (1975), under fire from a crazed sniper in The Deadly Tower (1975), an undercover FBI man in the action/comedy O Expresso de Chicago (1976), as Lex Luthor's bumbling assistant, Otis, in the blockbuster Superman: O Filme (1978)... and he returned again with Gene Hackman to play Otis and Lex Luthor again in Superman II: A Aventura Continua (1980).Beatty continued to remain busy throughout the 1980s with appearances in several big budget television productions including Os \u00daltimos Dias de Pomp\u00e9ia (1984). However, the overall caliber of the productions in general did not match up to those he had appeared in during the 1970s. Nonetheless, Beatty still shone in films including Acerto de Contas (1986) and O Quarto Protocolo (1987). Into the 1990s, Beatty's work output swung between a mixture of roles in family orientated productions (Gulliver's Travels (1996), Back to Hannibal: The Return of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn (1990), etc.) taking advantage of his \"fatherly\" type looks, but he could still accentuate a hard edge, and additionally was cast in Assassinatos na R\u00e1dio WBN (1994) and Justa Causa (1995). His many other films include O Brinquedo (1982), Todos os Homens do Presidente (1976), Sangue Selvagem (1979), Rudy (1993), Spring Forward (1999), Escute Minha Can\u00e7\u00e3o (1991) -- for which he earned a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actor -- Por tr\u00e1s Daquele Beijo (1992), Jogada Decisiva (1998) and A Fortuna de Cookie (1999). Beatty's numerous television credits include three years on the NBC series Homicide: Life on the Street (1993), Laredo: O \u00daltimo Desafio (1995), and The Boys (1993).Beatty received an Emmy Award nomination for Best Actor for his performance in Friendly Fire (1979) opposite Carol Burnett, and a Best Supporting Actor nomination for Family Channel's Last Train Home (1989).

His elder brother was , Arthur S. Newman Jr., named for their father, a Jewish businessman who owned a successful sporting goods store and was the son of emigrants from Poland and Hungary. Newman's mother (born Ter\u00e9zia Feckov\u00e1, daughter of Stefan Fecko and M\u00e1ria Polenak) was a Roman Catholic Slovak from Homonna, Pticie (former Austro-Hungarian Empire), who became a practicing Christian Scientist. She and her brother, Newman's uncle Joe, had an interest in the creative arts, and it rubbed off on him. He acted in grade school and high school plays. The Newmans were well-to-do and Paul Newman grew up in affluent Shaker Heights. Before he became an actor, Newman ran the family sporting goods store in Cleveland, Ohio.By 1950, the 25-year-old Newman had been kicked out of Ohio University, where he belonged to the Phi Kappa Tau fraternity, for unruly behavior (denting the college president's car with a beer keg), served three years in the United States Navy during World War II as a radio operator, graduated from Ohio's Kenyon College, married his first wife, Jacqueline \"Jackie\" Witte (born 1929), and had his first child, Scott. That same year, his father died. When he became successful in later years, Newman said if he had any regrets it would be that his father was not around to witness his success. He brought Jackie back to Shaker Heights and he ran his father's store for a short period. Then, knowing that wasn't the career path he wanted to take, he moved Jackie and Scott to New Haven, Connecticut, where he attended Yale University's School of Drama.While doing a play there, Newman was spotted by two agents, who invited him to come to New York City to pursue a career as a professional actor. After moving to New York, he acted in guest spots for various television series and in 1953 came a big break. He got the part of understudy of the lead role in the successful Broadway play \"Picnic\". Through this play, he met actress Joanne Woodward (born 1930), who was also an understudy in the play. While they got on very well and there was a strong attraction, Newman was married and his second child, Susan, was born that year. During this time, Newman was accepted into the much admired and popular New York Actors Studio, although he did not actually audition.In 1954, a film Newman was very reluctant to do was released, O C\u00e1lice Sagrado (1954). He considered his performance in this costume epic to be so bad that he took out a full-page ad in a trade paper apologizing for it to anyone who might have seen it. He had always been embarrassed about the film and reveled in making fun of it. He immediately wanted to return to the stage, and performed in \"The Desperate Hours\". In 1956, he got the chance to redeem himself in the film world by portraying boxer Rocky Graziano in Marcado pela Sarjeta (1956), and critics praised his performance. In 1957, with a handful of films to his credit, he was cast in O Mercador de Almas (1958), co-starring Joanne Woodward.During the shooting of this film, they realized they were meant to be together and by now, so did his then-wife Jackie, who gave Newman a divorce. He and Woodward wed in Las Vegas in January 1958. They went on to have three daughters together and raised them in Westport, Connecticut. In 1959, Newman received his first Academy Award nomination for Best Actor, in Gata em Teto de Zinco Quente (1958). The 1960s would bring Newman into superstar status, as he became one of the most popular actors of the decade, and garnered three more Best Actor Oscar nominations, for Desafio \u00e0 Corrup\u00e7\u00e3o (1961), O Indomado (1963) and Rebeldia Indom\u00e1vel (1967). In 1968, his debut directorial effort Rachel, Rachel (1968) was given good marks, and although the film and Woodward were nominated for Oscars, Newman was not nominated for Best Director. However, he did win a Golden Globe Award for his direction.1969 brought the popular screen duo of Newman and Robert Redford together for the first time when Butch Cassidy (1969) was released. It was a box office smash. Through the 1970s, Newman had hits and misses from such popular films as Golpe de Mestre (1973) and Inferno na Torre (1974) to lesser known films as Roy Bean - O Homem da Lei! (1972) to a cult classic Vale Tudo (1977). After the death of his only son, Scott, in 1978, Newman's personal life and film choices moved in a different direction. His acting work in the 1980s and on is what is often most praised by critics today. He became more at ease with himself and it was evident in O Veredicto (1982) for which he received his sixth Best Actor Oscar nomination and, in 1987, finally received his first Oscar for A Cor do Dinheiro (1986), almost thirty years after Woodward had won hers. Friend and director of Marcado pela Sarjeta (1956), Robert Wise accepted the award on Newman's behalf as the actor did not attend the ceremony.Films were not the only thing on his mind during this period. A passionate race car driver since the early 1970s (despite being color-blind), he was co-founder of Newman-Haas racing in 1982, and also founded \"Newman's Own\", a successful line of food products that has earned in excess of $100 million, every penny of which Newman donated to charity. He also started The Hole in the Wall Gang Camps, an organization for children with serious illness. He was as well known for his philanthropic ways and highly successful business ventures as he was for his legendary actor status.Newman's marriage to Woodward lasted a half-century. Connecticut was their primary residence after leaving Hollywood and moving East in 1960. Renowned for his sense of humor, in 1998 he quipped that he was a little embarrassed to see his salad dressing grossing more than his movies. During his later years, he still attended races, was much involved in his charitable organizations, and in 2006, he opened a restaurant called Dressing Room, which helps out the Westport Country Playhouse, a place in which Newman took great pride. In 2007, while the public was largely unaware of the serious illness from which he was suffering, Newman made some headlines when he said he was losing his invention and confidence in his acting abilities and that acting was \"pretty much a closed book for me\". A smoker for many years, Newman died on September 26, 2008, aged 83, from lung cancer.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Tom McDonough/Robert Sieger\n          \n\n", "realName": "Paul Leonard Newman", "height": "177"},

He is of English, Scottish, Cornish, and Irish ancestry. Robert's mother died in 1955, the year after he graduated from high school. Robert was a scrappy kid who stole hubcaps in school and lost his college baseball scholarship at the University of Colorado because of drunkenness.After leaving UoC, he spent some time drifting across America, spending a time working in the California oil fields. Having saved enough he moved to Europe studying art in Paris and Florence.Back in the States he decided on a career as a theatrical designer in New York. Enrolling at the American Academy of Dramatic Art he turned to acting making his stage debut in 'Tall Story'. In 1962 he was signed for the stage production of 'Barefoot in the Park' which was a smash hit but it wasn't until 5 years later when it was filmed that he became an important star.Television and stage experience coupled with all-American good looks led to movies and television roles. His breakthrough role was \"The Sundance Kid\" in Butch Cassidy (1969), when the actor was 33. Nosso Amor de Ontem (1973) and Golpe de Mestre (1973), both in 1973, made Redford the number one box office star for the next three years. Redford used his clout to advance environmental causes and his riches to acquire Utah property, which he transformed into a ranch and the Sundance ski resort. In 1980, he established the Sundance Institute for aspiring filmmakers. Its annual film festival has become one of the world's most influential. Redford's directorial debut, Gente como a Gente (1980), won him the Academy Award as Best Director in 1981. He waited eight years before getting behind the camera again, this time for the screen version of John Nichols' acclaimed novel of the Southwest, Rebeli\u00e3o em Milagro (1988). He scored with critics and fans in 1992 with the Brad Pitt film Nada \u00e9 para Sempre (1992), and again, in 1994, with Quiz Show: A Verdade dos Bastidores (1994), which earned him yet another Best Director nomination.Lola Van Wagenen (consumer activist) dropped out of college to marry Redford on August 9, 1958. They divorced in 1985 after having four children, one of whom died of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Daughter Shauna Redford, born November 15, 1960, is a painter who married Eric Schlosser on October 5, 1985, in Provo, UT. Her first child, born in January 1991, made Redford a grandfather.

His paternal grandfather was Scottish, from Argyll. Shaw's mother, who was born in Piggs Peak, Swaziland, met his father while she was a nurse at a hospital in Truro, Cornwall. His father was an alcoholic and a manic depressive; he committed suicide when Robert was only 12. He had three sisters--Elisabeth, Joanna and Wendy--and one brother, Alexander.As a boy, he attended school in Truro and was quite an athlete, competing in rugby, squash and track events but turned down an offer for a scholarship at 17 to go to London, with further education in Cambridge, as he did not want a career in medicine but, luckily for the rest of us, in acting. He was also inspired by one of the schoolmasters, Cyril Wilkes, who got him to read just about everything, including all of the classics. Wilkes would take three or four of the boys to London to see plays. The first play Robert would ever see was \"Hamlet\" in 1944 with Sir John Gielgud at the Haymarket. Robert went to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts with a \u00a31,000 inheritance from his grandmother. He went on from the Academy, after two years (1946-1948) to Stratford-on-Avon, where he was directed by Gielgud, who said to Shaw, \"I do admire you and think you've got a lot of ability, and I'd like to help you, but you make me so nervous.\" He then went on to make his professional stage debut in 1949 and tour Australia in the same year with the Old Vic.He had joined the Old Vic at the invitation of Tyrone Guthrie, who had directed him as the Duke of Suffolk in \"Henry VIII\" at Stratford. He played nothing but lesser Shakespearean roles, Cassio in \"Othello\" and Lysander in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" and toured Europe and South Africa with the company. Shaw was sold on Shakespeare and thought that it would be his theatrical life at that stage. He was discovered while performing in \"Much Ado About Nothing\" in 1950 at Stratford by Sir Alec Guinness, who suggested he come to London to do Hamlet with him. He then went on to his first film role, a very small part in the classic O Mist\u00e9rio da Torre (1951) with Guinness but a start nonetheless. It was also at this time that he married his first wife, Jennifer Bourne, an actress he had met while working at the Old Vic, and married her in Sallsbury, South Rhodesia, on August 1, 1952. Together they would have four daughters: Deborah, Penny, Rachel and Katherine.He would also appear briefly in Labaredas do Inferno (1955) and did the London production of \"Tiger at the Gates\" in June 1955 as Topman. He would also make \"Hill in Korea\" around that time and then, after taking on several jobs as a struggling actor and to support his growing family, he would be cast as Dan Tempest in The Buccaneers (1956). Shaw did not take his role seriously but made \u00a310,000 for eight months' work. It was around that time that he wrote his first novel, \"The Hiding Place.\" It was a success, selling 12,000 copies in England and about the same in France and in the United States. He also wrote a dramatization of it that was produced on commercial television in England, and Playhouse 90 (1956) aired a different dramatization in America. Around 1959, he became involved with well-known actress Mary Ure, who was married to actor John Osborne at the time. He slipped her his telephone number one night at 3 a.m. while visiting the couple, and she called him the next day. It was around then, in 1960, that Robert Shaw became a reporter for England's Queen magazine and covered the Olympics in Rome. Shaw and Ure acted together in Middleton's The Changeling at the Royal Court Theatre in London in 1961. He was playing the part of an ugly servant in love with the mistress of the house, who persuades him to murder her fiance. Shaw and Ure had a child on August 31 even though they were still married to their other spouses. His wife, Jennifer, and Ure had children of his only weeks apart from each other. Ure divorced Osborne and married Shaw in April 1963. The couple was often quoted by the press as being \"very much in love,\" and they would have four children together: Colin, Elizabeth, Hannah and Ian. That same year, after making the next two films, O Valente dos Mares (1962) and The Caretaker (1963), he made Moscou Contra 007 (1963) and was unforgettable as blond assassin, Donald 'Red' Grant.He also made Tomorrow at Ten (1963), as well as a TV version of Hamlet as Claudius. He would then film The Luck of Ginger Coffey (1964) with Ure and then star in Uma Batalha no Inferno (1965) as German Panzer commander Hessler. He wrote \"The Flag\" on the set of the film. He was nominated for his next role, as Henry VIII in O Homem que N\u00e3o Vendeu sua Alma (1966), an outstanding, unequal lead performance. He would write his fourth novel \"The Man in the Glass Booth,\" which was later made into a play with Donald Pleasence and later into a film with Maximilian Schell. In 1967, he again starred with his wife in Os Bravos N\u00e3o se Rendem (1967) and went on to The Birthday Party (1969) and A Batalha da Gr\u00e3-Bretanha (1969). One of his best performances of this decade was also as Spanish conqueror Pizarro in Real Ca\u00e7ador do Sol (1969). His last published novel, \"A Card from Morocco,\" was also a big success and he went on to make No Limiar da Liberdade (1970) with Malcolm McDowell as two escaped convicts in a Latin American country. As the father of Churchill in As Garras do Le\u00e3o (1972), he was once again his brilliant self, stealing the scene from John Mills, Patrick Magee, Anthony Hopkins and Ian Holm. After his portrayal of Lord Randolph Churchill, he made A Imagem do Medo (1972), a horror movie with Ure, Sondra Locke and Sally Kellerman. As chauffeur Steven Ledbetter in O Assalariado (1973), he falls in love with Sarah Miles, an aristocratic widow he helps recover from a nervous breakdown. The film took the prestigious Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and was quite a thought-provoking film.It was his performances in the following two films--USA-produced Golpe de Mestre (1973) and O Seq\u00fcestro do Metr\u00f4 (1974)--that Shaw became familiar once again to American audiences, but it was his portrayal as a grizzled Irish shark hunter named Quint, in Tubar\u00e3o (1975), that everyone remembers--even to this day. Hard to believe that Shaw wasn't that impressed with the script and even confided to a friend, Hector Elizondo: \"They want me to do a movie about this big fish. I don't know if I should do it or not.\" When Elizondo asked why Shaw had reservations, Shaw said he'd never heard of the director and didn't like the title, \"JAWS.\" It's also incredible that as the biggest box office film at the time, which was the first to gross more than $100 million worldwide and that he had ever been part of, he didn't make a cent from it because of the taxes he had to pay from working in the United States, Canada and Ireland. It was also during that time that he became a depressed recluse following the death of his wife, who had taken an accidental overdose of barbiturates and alcohol. Some have speculated throughout the years that her death was suicidal, but there was no evidence of that, and so it is mere sensationalism. Following Diamantes (1975), he made Aposta Fatal (1975) and then delivered another brilliant performance as the Sheriff of Nottingham in Robin E Marian (1976). During the same year, he also made O Pirata Escarlate (1976) with Genevi\u00e8ve Bujold and James Earl Jones, a very lighthearted pirate adventure.His next film, Domingo Negro (1977), with Shaw playing an Israeli counterterrorist agent trying to stop a terrorist organization called Black September, which is plotting an attack at the Super Bowl, was a big success both with critics and at the box office. I wasn't surprised, considering the depth to which he was also involved in writing the script, although he didn't receive billing for it. Shaw was very happy with the success of his acting career but remained a depressed recluse in his personal life until he finished Domingo Negro (1977), when he found himself in love with his secretary of 15 years, Virginia Dewitt Jansen (Jay). They were wed on July 29, 1976, in Hamilton, Bermuda. He adopted her son, Charles, and the couple also had one son, Thomas. During his stay in Bermuda, Shaw began work on his next movie, O Fundo do Mar (1977), which teamed him and writer Peter Benchley once again, which may have been a mistake in that everyone expected another Tubar\u00e3o (1975). At one point, discussing how bad the film was going, Shaw could be quoted as saying to Nick Nolte, \"It's a treasure picture Nick; it's a treasure picture.\" It did well at the box office but not with critics, although they did hail Shaw as the saving grace. He had done it for the money, as he was to do with his next film, for he had decided when Ure died that life was short and he needed to provide for his 10 children.In 1977, Shaw traveled to Yugoslavia, where he starred in Comando 10 de Navarone (1978), a sequel to Os Canh\u00f5es de Navarone (1961). He revived the lead role of British MI6 agent Mallory, originally played by Gregory Peck. He was a big box office draw, and some producers were willing to pay top wages for his work, but he felt restricted by the parts he was being offered. \"I have it in mind to stop making these big-budget extravaganzas, to change my pattern of life. I wanted to prove, I think, that I could be an international movie star. Now that I've done it, I see the valuelessness of it.\" In early 1978, Shaw appeared in P\u00e2nico no Atlantico Express (1979) which was to become the last film in which he played General Marenkov, a senior Russian official who decides to defect to the West and reveals to a CIA agent, played by Lee Marvin, that the Russians are trying to develop biological weapons. An alcoholic most of his life, Shaw died--before the film was completed--of a heart attack at the age of 51 on August 28, 1978. In poor health due to alcoholism during most of the filming, he in fact completed over 90% of his scenes before the death of director Mark Robson two months earlier, in June 1978, brought production to a halt.While living in Ireland and taking a hiatus from work, Shaw was driving from Castlebar to his home in Tourmakeady, Ireland, with wife, Virginia, and young son, Thomas, after spending the day playing golf with friends on a local course as well as shopping with Virginia in the town. As they approached their cottage, he felt chest pains which he claimed to Virginia had started earlier that day while he was playing golf but whose pains subsided. He pulled the car over a few hundred yards from his cottage and told her he would get out and walk the pains off. After taking four or five steps from the parked car, he collapsed by the side of the road, and his wife ran to the cottage to phone for help. An ambulance arrived 15 minutes later, and Shaw was taken to Mayo General Hospital in Castlebar, where he was pronounced dead on arrival.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Anonymous and Suzy of A Robert Shaw For All Seasons\n          \n\n", "realName": "Robert Archibald Shaw", "height": "178"},

His father was an Irish immigrant and his mother was of Irish descent. Durning first got his start in guest appearances in early 1960's TV shows. He scored minor roles over the next decade until he really got noticed by film fans as the sneering, corrupt cop \"Lt.

His work was frequently derided as 'impersonal' or lacking in stylistic trademarks. Andrew Sarris famously referred to it as 'idiosyncratic, odious, oiliness'. Hill, himself didn't help his own cause by shunning the limelight, avoiding appearances on chat shows and often keeping the press off his sets.In a rare interview for a book by Edward Shores in 1983, he declared: \"I find publicity distasteful, and I don't think it does the picture any good to focus on the director\" (LA Times, Dec. 28 2002). Conversely, Hill was 'commercially reliable', a winner with the public and with the academy, picking up an Oscar and a Director's Guild Award for \"The Sting\" and a BAFTA for \"Butch\". At his best, Hill was an 'actor's director': a gifted storyteller, with a powerful sense of narrative, and a nostalgic flair for detail. His world was inhabited by individualists, often outsiders, or loners, harbouring unattainable ideals or fantasies, or trying to escape from the realities of a humdrum existence. According to biographer Andrew Horton, Hill framed \"a serious view of life in a comic-ironic vein, manipulating genres for his own purposes\" (A. Horton, \"The Films of George Roy Hill\", p.7).Hill was born to a wealthy Roman Catholic family of Irish background (owners of the Minneapolis Tribune) and educated at private school, followed by graduate studies in music at Yale under the auspices of composer Paul Hindemith. While at university, he became involved with the Yale Dramatic Society and was at one time elected its president. After his graduation, he served as a transport pilot with the U.S. Marines for the duration of World War II. Hill was recalled as a night fighter pilot for the Korean War, rising to the rank of major. From this, Hill developed a lifelong passion for flying which often reflected in his films (he held a pilot's license from the age of seventeen and later acquired a 1930 Waco biplane, which he took on spins in his spare time -- whenever he was not indulging his other favourite pastimes of reading history or listening to recordings of Johann Sebastian Bach). In 1949, he gained his B.A. in literature from Trinity College, Dublin.Remaining in Ireland, Hill first acted on stage with Cyril Cusack's company, making his debut in \"The Devil's Disciple\" at the Gaiety Theatre. He then appeared on Broadway in \"Richard II\" and \"The Taming of the Shrew\". After Korea, he divided his time between writing/directing live anthology TV (1954-59) and directing plays on and off Broadway (1957-62).Hill's cinematic breakthrough came with Contramarcha Nupcial (1962), featuring an up-and-coming Jane Fonda (Hill had previously directed the original Tennessee Williams play on Broadway, featuring Barbara Baxley in the Fonda part). After eliciting strong performances from both Geraldine Page and Wendy Hiller in his filming of Lillian Hellman's Na Voragem das Paix\u00f5es (1963), he followed up with a moderately successful comedy O Mundo de Henry Orient (1964) which centred around a second rate pianist (Peter Sellers) as the object of fantasies by 2 teenage girls. This films put him on the map.However, his fourth film, Hava\u00ed (1966), shot at the cost of $15 million (a little bit more than $100 million, adjusted for inflation), was a critical and box office failure, though quickly redeemed by the exuberant Positivamente Millie (1967), one of the best musicals of the 1960's (and possibly the zaniest ever made!). It was Hill's next pair of films - using the same pair of actors - which was to firmly cement his place at the top.Hill was instrumental in securing the serendipitous pairing of Paul Newman with Robert Redford for the first of his two massive box office hits: \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\". He tenaciously fought studio executives who envisaged more seasoned performers like Jack Lemmon and Warren Beatty (or, possibly, Steve McQueen) in the respective parts. Hill's military discipline and predilection for stubbornness prevailed, while it was Newman who worked on Hill in setting the humorous tone for the picture. \"Butch and Sundance\" effectively reinvigorated the western genre. The Newman-Redford chemistry resumed with the best caper comedy of its day, \"The Sting\", which was inspired by the exploits of Fred and Charlie Gondorf, famous practitioners of the 'big store' confidence racket in the early 1900's. Complete with a clever trick ending, this was, arguably, Hill's crowning achievement.To lend the film authenticity, Hill used very little camera movement and shot the picture in the 'flat-camera' style so typical of Warner Brothers gangster films of the 30's and 40's. The inter-titles - with drawings reminiscent of The Saturday Evening Post - helped lend the film a bit of 'retro-cachet' as well. Aided by Henry Bumstead's elaborately constructed, 'aged' sets, rotogravure cinematography by Robert Surtees and costumes by Edith Head, the film grossed some $68.4 million (almost $315million, adjusted for inflation, in '17) during its initial run. It went on to garner seven Oscars.Sadly, none of Hill's later efforts ever came close to emulating these successes, not even a pet project -- Quando as \u00c1guias se Encontram (1975) -- for which Hill provided the original story (about a pioneer flying ace (Redford) whose quest to prove himself is stymied by progress and changing values). Vale Tudo (1977), a drama about minor league ice hockey, was another near miss. It failed to find mass audience support despite the star power of Paul Newman, mainly because of its excessive violence and crass language. However, it gained something of a cult following among sports enthusiasts in later years. Hill sadly rounded off his career with a lame duck farce, misleadingly titled Uma Fazenda do Barulho (1988).By then, Hill had left Hollywood to teach drama at Yale. He also donated original materials, including story boards, interviews, stills, scene sketches and set designs from the making of \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" and Matadouro Cinco (1972) to the Sterling Memorial Library in New Haven, Connecticut. One of few entirely unpretentious, self-effacing film makers whose directness and confrontational manner unnerved actors (Newman and Redford excepted!) and studio execs alike, Hill died in New York from Parkinson's Disease on December 27, 2002.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            I.S.Mowis\n          \n\n", "realName": null, "height": null},

Born in Cologne, he served as a cadet in a Prussian military academy before finishing his matriculation. He then began to attend acting classes and studying art history in Berlin and Bonn, making his debut on the stage in 1909. After playing in theatres in towns and cities along the Rhine and northern Germany for nearly ten years, he started making films in 1919.His villainous roots first came to the fore in O Gabinete do Dr. Caligari (1920), but he really established his reputation in a series of classic expressionist films written by his then-wife Thea von Harbou and directed by Fritz Lang. Of these, the most memorable were his forceful Moriarty-inspired portrayals of the titular character in Dr. Mabuse, o Jogador (1922), and its later sequel, O Testamento do Dr. Mabuse (1933). The latter, which has an evil mastermind directing his empire from a madhouse, was so obviously aimed at the Hitler regime, that it was banned by Joseph Goebbels. Klein-Rogge's other noteworthy appearances include King Etzel in Os Nibelungos - A Morte de Siegfried (1924) and A Vingan\u00e7a de Kriemhilde (1924); and his insane scientist C.A. Rothwang, creator of the robot creature in Fritz Lang's masterpiece Metr\u00f3polis (1927). A powerful personality possessed of an almost hypnotic stare and a strong, resonant voice, Klein-Rogge continued on through the 1930's in supporting roles. However, the period of expressionist cinema in Germany had all but run its course and he died in relative obscurity in Graz, Austria, in April 1955.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            I.S.Mowis\n          \n\n", "realName": "Friedrich Rudolf Klein-Rogge", "height": "173"},

True, his earliest work is mostly dismissed as pedestrian, but no other actor working in the 1940s and 50s was able to score so supremely whenever cast against type.Frederick Martin MacMurray was born in Kankakee, Illinois, to Maleta Martin and Frederick MacMurray. His father had Scottish ancestry and his mother's family was German. His father's sister was vaudeville performer and actress Fay Holderness. When MacMurray was five years old, the family moved to Beaver Dam in Wisconsin, his parents' birth state. He graduated from Beaver Dam High School (later the site of Beaver Dam Middle School), where he was a three-sport star in football, baseball, and basketball. Fred retained a special place in his heart for his small-town Wisconsin upbringing, referring at any opportunity in magazine articles or interviews to the lifelong friends and cherished memories of Beaver Dam, even including mementos of his childhood in several of his films. In \"Pardon my Past\", Fred and fellow GI William Demarest are moving to Beaver Dam, WI to start a mink farm.MacMurray earned a full scholarship to attend Carroll College in Waukesha, Wisconsin and had ambitions to become a musician. In college, MacMurray participated in numerous local bands, playing the saxophone. In 1930, he played saxophone in the Gus Arnheim and his Coconut Grove Orchestra when Bing Crosby was the lead vocalist and Russ Columbo was in the violin section. MacMurray recorded a vocal with Arnheim's orchestra \"All I Want Is Just One Girl\" -- Victor 22384, 3/20/30. He appeared on Broadway in the 1930 hit production of \"Three's a Crowd\" starring Sydney Greenstreet, Clifton Webb and Libby Holman. He next worked alongside Bob Hope in the 1933 production of \"Roberta\" before he signed on with Paramount Pictures in 1934 for the then-standard 7-year contract (the hit show made Bob Hope a star and he was also signed by Paramount). MacMurray married Lillian Lamont (D: June 22, 1953) on June 20, 1936, and they adopted two children.Although his early film work is largely overlooked by film historians and critics today, he rose steadily within the ranks of Paramount's contract stars, working with some of Hollywood's greatest talents, including wunderkind writer-director Preston Sturges (whom he intensely disliked) and actors Humphrey Bogart and Marlene Dietrich. Although the majority of his films of the 30's can largely be dismissed as standard fare there are exceptions: he played opposite Claudette Colbert in seven films, beginning with O L\u00edrio Dourado (1935). He also co-starred with Katharine Hepburn in the classic, A Mulher que Soube Amar (1935), and with Carole Lombard in Cora\u00e7\u00f5es Unidos (1935), Amor e \u00d3dio na Floresta (1936) -- an ambitious early outdoor 3-strip Technicolor hit, co-starring with Henry Fonda and Sylvia Sidney directed by Henry Hathaway -- A Princesa de Brooklyn (1936), and Confiss\u00e3o de Mulher (1937). MacMurray spent the decade learning his craft and developing a reputation as a solid actor. In an interesting sidebar, artist C.C. Beck used MacMurray as the initial model for a superhero character who would become Fawcett Comics' Captain Marvel in 1939.The 1940s gave him his chance to shine. He proved himself in melodramas such as Insuspeitos (1943) and musicals (Fantasia de Amor (1945)), somewhat ironically becoming one of Hollywood's highest-paid actors by 1943, when his salary reached $420,000. He scored a huge hit with the thoroughly entertaining O Ovo e Eu (1947), again teamed with Ms. Colbert and today largely remembered for launching the long-running Ma and Pa Kettle franchise. In 1941, MacMurray purchased a large parcel of land in Sonoma County, California and began a winery/cattle ranch. He raised his family on the ranch and it became the home to his second wife, June Haver after their marriage in 1954. The winery remains in operation today in the capable hands of their daughter, Kate MacMurray. Despite being habitually typecast as a \"nice guy\", MacMurray often said that his best roles were when he was cast against type by Billy Wilder. In 1944, he played the role of \"Walter Neff\", an insurance salesman (numerous other actors had turned the role down) who plots with a greedy wife Barbara Stanwyck to murder her husband in Pacto de Sangue (1944) -- inarguably the greatest role of his entire career. Indeed, anyone today having any doubts as to his potential depth as an actor should watch this film. He did another stellar turn in the \"not so nice\" category, playing the cynical, spineless \"Lieutenant Thomas Keefer\" in the 1954 production of A Nave da Revolta (1954), directed by Edward Dmytryk. He gave another superb dramatic performance cast against type as a hard-boiled crooked cop in A Morte Espera no 322 (1954).Despite these and other successes, his career waned considerably by the late 1950s and he finished out the decade working in a handful of non-descript westerns. MacMurray's career got its second wind beginning in 1959 when he was cast as the dog-hating father figure (well, he was a retired mailman) in the first Walt Disney live-action comedy, Felpudo, o C\u00e3o Feiticeiro (1959). The film was an enormous hit and Uncle Walt green lighted several projects around his middle-aged star. Billy Wilder came calling again and he did a masterful turn in the role of Jeff Sheldrake, a two-timing corporate executive in Wilder's Oscar-winning comedy-drama Se Meu Apartamento Falasse (1960), with Shirley MacLaine and Jack Lemmon -- arguably his second greatest role and the last one to really challenge him as an actor. Although this role would ultimately be remembered as his last great performance, he continued with the lightweight Disney comedies while pulling double duty, thanks to an exceptionally generous contract, on TV.MacMurray was cast in 1961 as Professor Ned Brainerd in Disney's O Fant\u00e1stico Super-Homem (1961) and in its superior sequel, O Fabuloso Criador de Encrencas (1963). These hit Disney comedies raised his late-career profile considerably and producer Don Fedderson beckoned with Meus 3 Filhos (1960) debuting in 1960 on ABC. The gentle sitcom staple remained on the air for 12 seasons (380 episodes). Concerned about his work load and time away from his ranch and family, Fred played hardball with his series contract. In addition to his generous salary, the \"Sons\" contract was written so that all the scenes requiring his presence to be shot first, requiring him to work only 65 days per season on the show (the contract was reportedly used as an example by Dean Martin when negotiating the wildly generous terms contained in his later variety show contract). This requirement meant the series actors had to work with stand-ins and posed wardrobe continuity issues. The series moved without a hitch to CBS in the fall of 1965 in color after ABC, then still an also-ran network with its eyes peeled on the bottom line, refused to increase the budget required for color production (color became a U.S. industry standard in the 1968 season). This freed him to pursue his film work, family, ranch, and his principal hobby, golf.Politically very conservative, MacMurray was a staunch supporter of the Republican Party; he joined his old friend Bob Hope and James Stewart in campaigning for Richard Nixon in 1968. He was also widely known one of the most -- to be polite -- frugal actors in the business. Stories floated around the industry in the 60s regarding famous hard-boiled egg brown bag lunches and stingy tips. After the cancellation of My Three Sons in 1972, MacMurray made only a few more film appearances before retiring to his ranch in 1978. As a result of a long battle with leukemia, MacMurray died of pneumonia at the age of eighty-three in Santa Monica on November 5, 1991. He was buried in the Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Dave Curbow and Mike Bischoff and Jack Backstreet\n          \n\n", "realName": "Frederick Martin MacMurray", "height": "190"},

But she was known to millions of other fans for her movie career, which spanned the period from 1927 until 1964, after which she appeared on television until 1986. It was a career that lasted for 59 years.Barbara Stanwyck was born Ruby Catherine Stevens on July 16, 1907, in Brooklyn, New York, to working class parents Catherine Ann (McPhee) and Byron E. Stevens. Her father, from Massachusetts, had English ancestry, and her Canadian mother, from Nova Scotia, was of Scottish and Irish descent. Stanwyck went to work at the local telephone company for fourteen dollars a week, but she had the urge (a dream--that was all it was) somehow to enter show business. When not working, she pounded the pavement in search of dancing jobs. The persistence paid off. Barbara was hired as a chorus girl for the princely sum of $40 a week, much better than the wages she was getting from the phone company. She was seventeen, and was going to make the most of the opportunity that had been given her.In 1928 Barbara moved to Hollywood, where she was to start one of the most lucrative careers filmdom had ever seen. She was an extremely versatile actress who could adapt to any role. Barbara was equally at home in all genres, from melodramas, such as A Mulher Proibida (1932) and Stella Dallas, M\u00e3e Redentora (1937), to thrillers, such as Pacto de Sangue (1944), one of her best films, also starring Fred MacMurray (as you have never seen him before). She also excelled in comedies such as Lembra-se Daquela Noite? (1940) and As Tr\u00eas Noites de Eva (1941). Another genre she excelled in was westerns, Alian\u00e7a de A\u00e7o (1939) being one of her first and TV's The Big Valley (1965) (her most memorable role) being her last. In 1983, she played in the ABC hit mini-series Os p\u00e1ssaros Feridos (1983), which did much to keep her in the eye of the public. She turned in an outstanding performance as Mary Carson.Barbara was considered a gem to work with for her serious but easygoing attitude on the set. She worked hard at being an actress, and she never allowed her star quality to go to her head. She was nominated for four Academy Awards, though she never won. She turned in magnificent performances for all the roles she was nominated for, but the \"powers that be\" always awarded the Oscar to someone else. However, in 1982 she was awarded an honorary Academy Award for \"superlative creativity and unique contribution to the art of screen acting.\" Sadly, Barbara died on January 20, 1990, leaving 93 movies and a host of TV appearances as her legacy to us.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Denny Jackson\n          \n\n", "realName": "Ruby Catherine Stevens", "height": "165"},

He took up acting while attending City College, abandoning plans to become a rabbi or lawyer. The American Academy of Dramatic Arts awarded him a scholarship, and he began work in stock, with his new name, Edward G. Robinson (the \"G\" stood for his birth surname), in 1913. Broadway was two years later; he worked steadily there for 15 years. His work included \"The Kibitzer\", a comedy he co-wrote with Jo Swerling. His film debut was a small supporting part in the silent O Chale Brilhante (1923), but it was with the coming of sound that he hit his stride. His stellar performance as snarling, murderous thug Rico Bandello in Alma no Lodo (1931)--all the more impressive since in real life Robinson was a sophisticated, cultured man with a passion for fine art--set the standard for movie gangsters, both for himself in many later films and for the industry. He portrayed the title character in several biographical works, such as A Vida do Dr. Ehrlich (1940) and Uma Mensagem de Reuter (1940). Psychological dramas included Os Mist\u00e9rios da Vida (1943), Pacto de Sangue (1944), Um Retrato de Mulher (1944)and Almas Perversas (1945). Another notable gangster role was in Paix\u00f5es em F\u00faria (1948). He was \"absolved\" of allegations of Communist affiliation after testifying as a friendly witness for the House Un-American Activities Committee during the McCarthy hysteria of the early 1950s. In 1956 he had to sell off his extensive art collection in a divorce settlement and also had to deal with a psychologically troubled son. In 1956 he returned to Broadway in \"Middle of the Night\". In 1973 he was awarded a special, posthumous Oscar for lifetime achievement.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Ed Stephan <stephan@cc.wwu.edu>\n          \n\n", "realName": "Emmanuel Goldenberg", "height": "170"},

He had Irish (from his paternal grandmother), English, and some German, ancestry. His parents divorced when he was five years old. An only child, he was sent to live with his grandmother. He never felt he had a stable childhood. His fondest memories are of his grandmother taking him to the movies every week and of his dog, which followed him everywhere. He studied pre-med at UC-Berkeley and, while there, got bitten by the acting bug and decided to change the focus of his studies. He enrolled in the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York and debuted on Broadway after graduation. His debut was in Emlyn Williams' play \"The Morning Star\" (1942). By 1943, he was in Hollywood, where he debuted in the RKO film Quando a Neve Tornar a Cair (1944).Stardom came with his next film, As Chaves do Reino (1944), for which he was nominated for an Academy Award. Peck's screen presence displayed the qualities for which he became well known. He was tall, rugged and heroic, with a basic decency that transcended his roles. He appeared in Alfred Hitchcock's Quando Fala o Cora\u00e7\u00e3o (1945) as an amnesia victim accused of murder. In Virtude Selvagem (1946), he was again nominated for an Academy Award and won the Golden Globe. He was especially effective in westerns and appeared in such varied fare as David O. Selznick's critically blasted Duelo ao Sol (1946), the somewhat better received C\u00e9u Amarelo (1948) and the acclaimed O Matador (1950). He was nominated again for the Academy Award for his roles in A Luz \u00e9 para Todos (1947), which dealt with anti-Semitism, and Almas em Chamas (1949), a story of high-level stress in an Air Force bomber unit in World War II.With a string of hits to his credit, Peck made the decision to only work in films that interested him. He continued to appear as the heroic, larger-than-life figures in such films as O Falc\u00e3o dos Mares (1951) and Moby Dick (1956). He worked with Audrey Hepburn in her debut film, A Princesa e o Plebeu (1953). Peck finally won the Oscar, after four nominations, for his performance as lawyer Atticus Finch in O Sol \u00e9 para Todos (1962). In the early 1960s, he appeared in two darker films than he usually made, C\u00edrculo do Medo (1962) and Pavilh\u00e3o 7 (1963), which dealt with the way people live. He also gave a powerful performance as Captain Keith Mallory in Os Canh\u00f5es de Navarone (1961), one of the biggest box-office hits of that year.In the early 1970s, he produced two films, The Trial of the Catonsville Nine (1972) and Entre Dois Destinos (1974), when his film career stalled. He made a comeback playing, somewhat woodenly, Robert Thorn in the horror film A Profecia (1976). After that, he returned to the bigger-than-life roles he was best known for, such as MacArthur, O General Rebelde (1977) and the monstrous Nazi Dr. Josef Mengele in the huge hit Meninos do Brasil (1978). In the 1980s, he moved into television with the miniseries The Blue and the Gray (1982) and O Escarlate e o Negro (1983). In 1991, he appeared in the remake of his 1962 film, playing a different role, in Martin Scorsese's Cabo do Medo (1991). He was also cast as the progressive-thinking owner of a wire and cable business in Com o Dinheiro dos Outros (1991).In 1967, Peck received the Academy's Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award. He was also been awarded the US Presidential Medal of Freedom. Always politically progressive, he was active in such causes as anti-war protests, workers' rights and civil rights. In 2003, his Peck's portrayal of Atticus Finch was named the greatest film hero of the past 100 years by the American Film Institute. Gregory Peck died at age 87 on June 12, 2003 in Los Angeles, California.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Tony Fontana <tony.fontana@spacebbs.com>\n          \n\n", "realName": "Eldred Gregory Peck", "height": "189"},

The latter was his only recurring role on television and he made the most of it, being strongly featured in several of the episodes. Prior to his well-remembered role as Elias Sandoval on the Jornada nas Estrelas (1966) episode, Jornada nas Estrelas: This Side of Paradise (1967), he had made notable appearances on two other science fiction series.He was twice featured on Al\u00e9m da Imagina\u00e7\u00e3o (1959). On the episode, Al\u00e9m da Imagina\u00e7\u00e3o: Walking Distance (1959), he played the father of advertising executive Martin Sloan (Gig Young), who, unhappy with his life such as it is, has somehow time-traveled back to his home town. Sloan finds, to his delight, that everything has remained unchanged from the time of his childhood. In a superbly-acted and touching scene, the elder Sloan (having come to terms with the identity of the stranger), asks his son to leave, because there can only ever be \"one summer per customer\". In contrast, Overton's chill, austere Sheriff Harry Wheeler on Al\u00e9m da Imagina\u00e7\u00e3o: Mute (1963) was the antithesis of his character on \"Walking Distance\", devoid of compassion or understanding. Overton also appeared as an unsympathetic physician on Os Invasores (1967) episode, Os Invasores: Genesis (1967).Overton's characterizations on stage largely paralleled those on screen. He made his first stab at Broadway as a lieutenant in Elia Kazan's comedy 'Jacobowsky and the Colonel', written by S.N. Behrman. The play ran for 417 performances from 1944 to 1945. He played another sheriff in 'The Trip to Bountiful' (1953) and replaced James Gregory as deputy Jesse Bard in the original stage version of 'The Desperate Hours' (1955). His most successful performance was as Morris Lacey in 'The Dark at the Top of the Stairs' (1957-59), a role he reprised for the film version of 1960.An actor who always looked older than his years, Frank Emmons Overton died of a heart attack in April 1967, aged only 49.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            I.S.Mowis\n          \n\n", "realName": "Francis Emmons Overton", "height": null},

Her brother, Warren Beatty, was born on March 30, 1937. Her ancestry includes English and Scottish.Shirley was the tallest in her ballet classes at the Washington School of Ballet. Just after she graduated from Washington-Lee High School, she packed her bags and headed for New York. While auditioning for Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II's \"Me and Juliet\", the producer kept mispronouncing her name. She then changed her name from Shirley MacLean Beaty to Shirley MacLaine. She later had a role in \"The Pajama Game\", as a member of the chorus and understudy to Carol Haney. A few months into the run, Shirley was going to leave the show for the lead role in \"Can-Can\" but ended up filling in for Haney, who had broken her ankle and could not perform. She would fill in for Carol, again, three months later, following another injury, the very night that movie producer Hal B. Wallis was in the audience. Wallis signed MacLaine to a five-year contract to Paramount Pictures. Three months later, she was off to shoot O Terceiro Tiro (1955). She then took roles in Quando Vem a Tormenta (1958) and A Volta ao Mundo em 80 Dias (1956), completed not too long before her daughter, Sachi Parker (born Stephanie), was born. With Shirley's career on track, she played one of her most challenging roles: \"Ginny Moorhead\" in Deus Sabe Quanto Amei (1958), for which she received her first Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. She went on to do O Irresist\u00edvel Forasteiro (1958) and A Mercadora de Felicidade (1958). In 1960, she got her second Academy Award nomination for Se Meu Apartamento Falasse (1960).

Some believed that such a career-defining role might leave him unable to escape it, but he proved the doubters wrong, becoming one of the most notable film actors of his generation, with a host of great movies to his name. This arguably culminated in his greatest acclaim in 1988, when Connery won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as an Irish cop in Os Intoc\u00e1veis (1987), stealing the thunder from the movie's principal star Kevin Costner. His film career also includes such films as Marnie, Confiss\u00f5es de uma Ladra (1964), O Nome da Rosa (1986), A Liga Extraordin\u00e1ria (2003), Indiana Jones e a \u00daltima Cruzada (1989), A Ca\u00e7ada ao Outubro Vermelho (1990), Highlander: O Guerreiro Imortal (1986), Assassinato no Expresso Oriente (1974), Cora\u00e7\u00e3o de Drag\u00e3o (1996) and A Rocha (1996). Connery has been polled as \"The Greatest Living Scot\" and \"Scotland's Greatest Living National Treasure\". In 1989, he was proclaimed \"Sexiest Man Alive\" by People magazine, and in 1999, at age 69, he was voted \"Sexiest Man of the Century\".Thomas Sean Connery was born on August 25, 1930 in Fountainbridge, Edinburgh, Scotland. His mother, Euphemia McBain (n\u00e9e McLean), was a cleaning lady, and his father, Joseph Connery, was a factory worker and truck driver. He has a brother, Neil Connery, who works as a plasterer in Edinburgh. He is of Irish and Scottish descent. Before going into acting, Sean had many different jobs, such as a milkman, lorry driver, a laborer, artist's model for the Edinburgh College of Art, coffin polisher and bodybuilder. He also joined the Royal Navy, but was later discharged because of medical problems. At the age of 23, he had a choice between becoming a professional footballer or an actor, and even though he showed much promise in the sport, he chose acting and said it was one of his more intelligent moves.No Road Back (1957) was Sean's first major movie role, and it followed by several Tv-movies such as Anna Christie (1957), Macbeth (1961) and Anna Karenina (1961) and guest appearances on TV-series, and also films such as Na Rota do Inferno (1957), V\u00edtima de uma Paix\u00e3o (1958), A Lenda dos An\u00f5es M\u00e1gicos (1959), At\u00e9 o \u00daltimo Gangster (1961). In 1962 he appeared in O Mais Longo dos Dias (1962) with a host of other stars.Connery's breakthrough came in the role of secret agent James Bond. He was reluctant to commit to a film series, but understood that if the films succeeded his career would greatly benefit. He played the character in the first five Bond films: O Sat\u00e2nico Dr. No (1962), Moscou Contra 007 (1963), 007 Contra Goldfinger (1964), 007 Contra a Chantagem At\u00f4mica (1965), and Com 007 S\u00f3 Se Vive Duas Vezes (1967) - then appeared again as Bond in 007 - Os Diamantes S\u00e3o Eternos (1971) and 007 - Nunca Mais Outra Vez (1983). All seven films were commercially successful. James Bond, as portrayed by Connery, was selected as the third-greatest hero in cinema history by the American Film Institute. Connery's selection for the role of James Bond owed a lot to Dana Broccoli, wife of producer \"Cubby\" Broccoli, who is reputed to have been instrumental in persuading her husband that Connery was the right man. James Bond's creator, Ian Fleming, originally doubted Connery's casting, saying, \"He's not what I envisioned of James Bond looks\", and \"I'm looking for Commander Bond and not an overgrown stunt-man,\" adding that Connery (muscular, 6' 2\", and a Scot) was unrefined. Fleming's girlfriend told him that Connery had the requisite sexual charisma, and Fleming changed his mind after the successful O Sat\u00e2nico Dr. No (1962) premiere. He was so impressed, he created a half-Scottish, half-Swiss heritage for Bond in the later novels. Connery's portrayal of Bond owes much to stylistic tutelage from director Terence Young, polishing the actor while using his physical grace and presence for the action. Lois Maxwell, who played Miss Moneypenny, related that, \"Terence took Sean under his wing. He took him to dinner, showed him how to walk, how to talk, even how to eat.\" The tutoring was successful; Connery received thousands of fan letters a week, and the actor became one of the great male sex symbols of film. During the filming of 007 Contra a Chantagem At\u00f4mica (1965), Connery's life was in danger in the sequence with the sharks in Emilio Largo's pool. He had been concerned about this threat when he read the script. Connery insisted that Ken Adam build a special Plexiglas partition inside the pool, but, despite this, it was not a fixed structure and one of the sharks managed to pass through it. He had to abandon the pool immediately. Connery was forced to wear a toupee during each of the Bond movies because he had started balding at the age of 17. This didn't prevent Connery from being cast in roles, although it became more noticeable in his later years. In 2005, From Russia with Love was adapted by Electronic Arts into a video game, titled James Bond 007: From Russia with Love (2005), which featured all-new voice work by Connery as well as his likeness, and those of several of the film's supporting cast.After and during the success of the Bond-films he has maintained a successful career as an actor and has appeared in films, including Alfred Hitchcock's Marnie, Confiss\u00f5es de uma Ladra (1964), A Colina dos Homens Perdidos (1965), Assassinato no Expresso Oriente (1974), O Homem que Queria ser Rei (1975), O Vento e o Le\u00e3o (1975), Os Bandidos do Tempo (1981), Highlander: O Guerreiro Imortal (1986), O Nome da Rosa (1986), Os Intoc\u00e1veis (1987) (which earned him an Oscar for best actor in a supporting role), Indiana Jones e a \u00daltima Cruzada (1989), A Ca\u00e7ada ao Outubro Vermelho (1990), Sol Nascente (1993), A Rocha (1996), Encontrando Forrester (2000), and A Liga Extraordin\u00e1ria (2003).Sean married actress Diane Cilento in 1962 and they had a son, Jason Connery, born on January 11, 1963, he followed in his father's footsteps and also became an actor. The marriage ended in divorce in 1973. In 1975 he married Micheline Roquebrune and they have stayed married, they have no children together. He is also a grandfather. His son, Jason and his ex-wife, actress Mia Sara had a son, Dashiell Quinn Connery, in 1997.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            A.G. and Pedro Borges\n          \n\n", "realName": "Thomas Sean Connery", "height": "188"},

She is the youngest of three children. She was educated in a convent, where she gained a passion for the arts. She later studied at the National College of Fine Arts in Dublin, but left because she lacked the motivation and thought she would take a year off to think it out. Meanwhile, while sitting in a caf\u00e9 with friends, she was approached by a still photographer who asked her if she would be interested to model. Thinking she could use the pocket money, she said yes. Modeling proved to be both fun and lucrative, and very soon she did it professionally. Her modeling contracts led to commercial work, which would take her around the world. One day, a casting director saw her work and suggested she try acting instead. She was sent to London at age 19, where she quickly won an audition to appear in the new James Bond film, 007 - Na Mira dos Assassinos (1985). She so loved acting that she pursued a career in that direction. After her first film, she shot a few TV dramas in London and in Dublin, but her big break came when she was cast as Aryan seductress Dr. Elsa Schneider in Indiana Jones e a \u00daltima Cruzada (1989). Apparently she made a huge impression on Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, who loved her great sense of humor and her Grace Kelly looks. After Indiana Jones, which introduced her to Hollywood and to the United States, she was chosen to replace Cybill Shepherd as spokeswoman for L'Or\u00e9al. After that she shot a few B-movies in the United States, but at one point felt she missed Ireland too much, so she went back to Dublin. In 1994, she put her career on hold to spend more time with media heir Gavin O'Reilly, whom she had been dating for two years. In 1996 they married, and later had two children. In 2002, she was asked to cameo in the 'Michael Caine (I)_ comedy The Actors (2003), and there she regained a lust for the movie industry. The following summer, she shot As Minas do Rei Salom\u00e3o (2004) with co-star Patrick Swayze, and it's then that the whole ball started rolling again. In 2005, she and her husband divorced and she decided to re-launch her stalled career, but she quickly realized how difficult it was to break into this kind of business for a second time, especially after ten years away from the camera. Recently she appeared in the short film Benjamin's Struggle (2005), directed by newcomer Jamie Breese, and played a role in the well-known British series Waking the Dead (2000). In a recent interview, she said she was thrilled to be acting again, but added that she wasn't willing to accept anything for the sake of working. She is determined to find the right part, but she also wants to do different things: \"I'm fed up playing the nasty Nazi. I'd like to do something quite extreme.\"\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Hugo Ross\n          \n\n", "realName": null, "height": "175"},

He is the only child of Isabella Mary (Abbott), a secretary to the Dean of Sciences at McGill University, and John Orme Plummer, who sold securities and stocks. He is a great-grandson of John Abbott, who was Canada's third Prime Minister (from 1891 to 1892), and a great-great-great-grandson of Anglican clergyman John Bethune. He has Scottish, English, and Anglo-Irish ancestry. Plummer was raised in Senneville, Quebec, by Montreal.Until the 2009 Academy Awards were announced, it could be said about Plummer that he was the finest actor of the post-World War II period to fail to get an Academy Award. In that, he was following in the footsteps of the late great John Barrymore, whom Plummer so memorably portrayed on Broadway in a one-man show that brought him his second Tony Award.In 2010, Plummer finally got an Oscar nod for his portrayal of another legend, Leo Tolstoy in A \u00daltima Esta\u00e7\u00e3o (2009). Two years later, the first paragraph of his obituary was written when the 82-year-old Plummer became the oldest person in Academy history to win an Oscar. He won for playing a senior citizen who comes out as gay after the death of his wife in the movie Toda Forma de Amor (2010). As he clutched his statuette, the debonaire thespian addressed it thusly: \"You're only two years older than me darling, where have you been all of my life?\"Plummer then told the audience that at birth, \"I was already rehearsing my Academy acceptance speech, but it was so long ago mercifully for you I've forgotten it.\"The Academy Award was a long time in coming and richly deserved.Aside from the youngest member of the Barrymore siblings (which counted Oscar-winners Ethel Barrymore and Lionel Barrymore in their number), Christopher Plummer is the premier Shakespearean actor to come out of North America in the 20th century. He was particularly memorable as Hamlet, Iago and Lear, though his Macbeth opposite Glenda Jackson was -- and this was no surprise to him due to the famous curse attached to the \"Scottish Play\" -- a failure.Plummer also has given many fine portrayals on film, particularly as he grew older and settled down into a comfortable marriage with his third wife Elaine. He thanked her from the stage during the 2012 Oscar telecast, quipping that she \"deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for coming to my rescue every day of my life.\"Like another great stage actor, Richard Burton, the younger Plummer failed to connect with the screen in a way that would make him a star. Dynamic on stage, the charisma failed to transfer through the lens onto celluloid. Burton's early film career, when he was a contract player at 20th Century-Fox, failed to ignite despite his garnering two Oscar nominations early on. He did not become a superstar until the mid-1960s, after hooking up with Elizabeth Taylor on the set of Cle\u00f3patra (1963). It was Liz whom he credited with teaching him how to act on film.Christopher Plummer never succeeded as a leading man in films. Perhaps if he had been born earlier, and acted in the studio system of Hollywood's golden age, he could have been carefully groomed for stardom. As it was, he shared the English stage actors' disdain -- and he was equally at home in London as he was on the boards of Broadway or on-stage in his native Canada -- for the movies, which did not help him in that medium, as he has confessed. As he aged, Plummer excelled at character roles. He was always a good villain, this man who garnered kudos playing Lucifer on Broadway in Archibald Macleish's Pulitzer Prize-winning \"J.B.\".Though he likely always be remembered as \"Captain Von Trapp\" in the atomic bomb-strength blockbuster A Novi\u00e7a Rebelde (1965) (a film he publicly despised until softening his stance in his autobiography \"In Spite of Me\" (2008)), his later film work includes such outstanding performances as the best cinema Sherlock Holmes -- other than Basil Rathbone -- in Assassinato Por Decreto (1979), the chilling villain in O S\u00f3cio do Sil\u00eancio (1978), his iconoclastic Mike Wallace in O Informante (1999), the empathetic psychiatrist in Uma Mente Brilhante (2001), and as Leo Tolstoy in A \u00daltima Esta\u00e7\u00e3o (2009). It was this last role that finally brought him recognition from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences, when he was nominated as Best Actor in a supporting role.Plummer remains one of the most respected and honored actors performing in the English language. He has won two Emmy Awards out of six nominations stretching 46 years from 1959 and 2005, and one Genie Award in five nominations from 1980 to 2004. For his stage work, Plummer has racked up two Tony Awards on six nominations, the first in 1974 as Best Actor (Musical) for the title role in \"Cyrano\" and the second in 1997, as Best Actor (Play), in \"Barrymore\".Surprisingly, he did not win (though he was nominated) for his masterful 2004 performance of \"King Lear\", which he originated at the Stratford Festival in Ontario and brought down to Broadway for a sold-out run. His other Tony nominations show the wide range of his talent, from a 1959 nod for the Elia Kazan-directed production of Macleish's \"J.B.\" to recognition in 1994 for Harold Pinter's \"No Man's Land\", with a 1982 Best Actor (Play) nomination for his \"Iago\" in William Shakespeare's \"Othello\".He continues to be a very in-demand character actor in prestigious motion pictures. If he were English rather than Canadian, he would have been knighted long ago. (In 1968, he was awarded Companion of the Order of Canada, the country's highest civilian honor and one which required the approval of the sovereign, Queen Elizabeth II.) If he lived in the company town of Los Angeles rather than in Connecticut, he likely would have several more Oscar nominations before winning his first for \"The Last Station\".As it is, as attested to in his witty and well-written autobiography, Christopher Plummer has been amply rewarded in life. In 1970, Plummer - a self-confessed 43-year-old \"bottle baby\" - married his third wife, dancer Elaine Taylor, who helped wean him off his dependency on alcohol. They live happily with their dogs on a 30-acre estate in Weston, Connecticut. Although he spends the majority of his time in the United States, he remains a Canadian citizen.His daughter, with actress Tammy Grimes, is actress Amanda Plummer.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Jon C.

Both her parents had been in entertainment, her dad had played big-band jazz, and her mother had performed water ballet in several Esther Williams movies. Kim was introspective, from her father's side. As a schoolgirl, she was very shy. To help her overcome this, her parents had Kim study ballet from an early age. By the time she reached sweet sixteen, the once-shy Kim entered the Athens Junior Miss contest. From there, she went on to win the Junior Miss Georgia title, and traveled to New York to compete in the national Junior Miss pageant. Kim, who had blossomed to a 5' 7\" beauty, was offered a contract on the spot with the Ford Modeling Agency. At the age of 20, Kim was a top model commanding $1,000 a day. Throughout the early 1970s, she appeared on dozens of magazine covers and in hundreds of ads, most notably as the Breck girl. Kim took acting classes at the Neighborhood Playhouse, performed in various Greenwich Village clubs, and she sang under the stage name Chelsea. Kim moved to Los Angeles in 1976, ready to conquer Hollywood. Kim broke into television doing episodes of such hit series as As Panteras (1976). In 1980, she married Ron Snyder (they divorced in 1989). In movies, she had roles like being a Bond girl in 007 - Nunca Mais Outra Vez (1983) and playing a small-town Texan beauty in Nadine - Um Amor \u00e0 Prova de Bala (1987). Her breakout role was as photojournalist Vicki Vale in the blockbuster hit Batman (1989). There was no long-orchestrated campaign on her part to snag this plum role, Kim was a last-minute replacement for Sean Young. This took her to a career high.With perhaps too much disposable income, Kim headed up an investment group that purchased the entire town of Braselton, in her native Georgia, for $20 million (she would later have to sell it). In 1993, Kim married Alec Baldwin, and in 1995 they had a daughter, Ireland Eliesse. Kim took some time off to stay at home with her child. Kim, who loves animals and is a strict vegetarian, devoted energy to animal rights issues, and PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals), even posing for some ads. In 1997, Kim gave an Oscar-winning performance in the film noir classic Los Angeles: Cidade Proibida (1997). Kim's salary for \u00c1frica dos Meus Sonhos (2000) was $5,000,000, putting her firmly in the category of big-name movie star. And no doubt there are still many great things ahead, in the career of cover girl turned Oscar-winning actress Kim Basinger.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            kdhaisch@aol.com\n          \n\n", "realName": "Kimila Ann Basinger", "height": "172"},

Graham's father was a chief police inspector and probably inspired the constables Graham often portrayed later in comedy sketches. Graham studied medicine in college and earned an M.D., but he practiced medicine for only a few years.At Cambridge, he took part in a series of comedy revues and shortly after completing his medical studies at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, Graham realized what he wanted to do with his life. He wanted to perform comedy. In 1969, Graham along with University friends John Cleese, Eric Idle, Michael Palin, Terry Jones and American Terry Gilliam formed the own comedy group called Monty Python. Their BBC TV series Monty Python's Flying Circus (1969), which aired a short while later was a an instant hit. Their often self-referential style of humor was delightfully original but completely accessible to most audiences in the UK.Before the show appeared on public television in the US, many people assumed that Americans would find Monty Python much too British to consider it funny. But PBS never had a larger audience than when stations began to air it during the early 1970s. The classic routines have since become standard college humor.So enduring was the Python humor that fans know entire sketches such as \"The Pet Shop,\" \"Nudge-Nudge, Wink-Wink,\" \"Argument Clinic,\" and \"Penguin on the Telly.\" Graham was a standout of the group with his tall, blond profile and his zany characters (one of the more memorable was Muriel Volestrangler, a vaguely military-type character who would stop a sketch because it was \"much too silly\").Graham was openly gay long before it was socially acceptable, and was open about his long-term relationship with writer David Sherlock, who lived with him for 24 years. He even adopted and raised a teenage runaway named John Tomiczek. Graham played the title role in the movie A Vida de Brian (1979) as well as King Arthur in Monty Python em Busca do C\u00e1lice Sagrado (1975). By the late 1970s most of the Python members were pursuing independent movie projects and the group slowly faded into obscurity. In 1983 he co-wrote and starred in the movie O Pirata da Barba Amarela (1983), which received negative reviews.In 1988, Graham began working on another series when his health began to decline. A longtime alcoholic, who suffered liver damage before he stopped drinking in 1977, Graham began to have trouble concentrating at work. In November 1988, a routine visit to a dentist revealed a malignant tumor on his tonsil which was surgically removed. A visit to the doctor revealed another tumor on his spine which had to be removed which confined him to a wheelchair. During most of 1989, he underwent a series of operations and radiation therapy but for every tumor that was found and removed, another would form either along his spine or in his throat. In his wheelchair, he attended the September 1989 taping for the Monthy Python's 20th anniversary special. But on October 1, he was hospitalized after a massive stroke which turned into a hemorrhage. He died at the age of 48 on 4 October, 1989 from complications of the stroke as well as throat and spinal cancer.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Matthew Patay\n          \n\n", "realName": "Graham Arthur Chapman", "height": "191"},

He was born into a family of modest means, his father being an insurance salesman; but he was nonetheless sent off to private schools to obtain a good education. Here he was often tormented for his height, having reached a height of six feet by the age of twelve, and eventually discovered that being humorous could deflect aggressive behavior in others. He loved humor in and of itself, collected jokes, and, like many young Britons who would grow up to be comedians, was devoted to the radio comedy show, \"The Goon Show,\" starring the legendary Peter Sellers, Spike Milligan, and Harry Secombe.Cleese did well in both sports and academics, but his real love was comedy. He attended Cambridge to read (study) Law, but devoted a great deal of time to the university's legendary Footlights group, writing and performing in comedy reviews, often in collaboration with future fellow Python Graham Chapman. Several of these comedy reviews met with great success, including one in particular which toured under the name \"Cambridge Circus.\" When Cleese graduated, he went on to write for the BBC, then rejoined Cambridge Circus in 1964, which toured New Zealand and America. He remained in America after leaving Cambridge Circus, performing and doing a little journalism, and here met Terry Gilliam, another future Python.Returning to England, he began appearing in a BBC radio series, \"I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again\", based on Cambridge Circus. It ran for several years and also starred future Goodies Tim Brooke-Taylor, Bill Oddie and Graeme Garden. He also appeared, briefly, with Brooke-Taylor, Graham Chapman and Marty Feldman in At Last the 1948 Show (1967), for television, and a series of collaborations with some of the finest comedy-writing talent in England at the time, some of whom - Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones, Michael Palin, and Chapman - eventually joined him in Monty Python. These programs included The Frost Report (1966) and Marty Feldman's program Marty (1968). Eventually, however, the writers were themselves collected to be the talent for their own program, Monty Python's Flying Circus (1969), which displayed a strange and completely absorbing blend of low farce and high-concept absurdist humor, and remains influential to this day.After three seasons of the intensity of Monty Python, Cleese left the show, though he collaborated with one or more of the other Pythons for decades to come, including the Python movies released in the mid-70s to early 80s - Monty Python em Busca do C\u00e1lice Sagrado (1975), A Vida de Brian (1979), Monty Python - Ao Vivo no Hollywood Bowl (1982), and Monty Python - O Sentido da Vida (1983). Cleese and then-wife Connie Booth collaborated in the legendary television series Fawlty Towers (1975), as the sharp-tongued, rude, bumbling yet somehow lovable proprietor of an English seaside hotel. Cleese based this character on a proprietor he had met while staying with the other Pythons at a hotel in Torquay, England. Only a dozen episodes were made, but each is truly hilarious, and he is still closely associated with the program to this day.Meanwhile Cleese had established a production company, Video Arts, for clever business training videos in which he generally starred, which were and continue to be enormously successful in the English-speaking world. He continues to act prolifically in movies, including in the hit comedy Um Peixe Chamado Wanda (1988), in the Harry Potter series, and in the James Bond series as the new Q, starting with 007 - O Mundo N\u00e3o \u00e9 o Bastante (1999), in which he began as R before graduating to Q. Cleese also supplies his voice to numerous animated and video projects, and frequently does commercials.Besides the infamous Basil Fawlty character, Cleese's other well-known trademark is his rendition of an English upper-class toff. He has a daughter with Connie Booth and a daughter with his second wife, Barbara Trentham.Education and learning are important elements of his life - he was Rector of the University of Saint Andrews from 1973 until 1976, and continues to be a professor-at-large of Cornell University in New York. Cleese lives in Santa Barbara, California.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Larry-115\n          \n\n", "realName": "John Marwood Cleese", "height": "196"},

Denied the role in the film version of the show, Rickman instead made his first film appearance opposite Bruce Willis in Duro de Matar (1988) as the villainous Hans Gruber. His take on the urbane villain set the standard for screen villains for decades to come.Although often cited as being a master of playing villains, Rickman actually played a wide variety of characters, such as the romantic cello-playing ghost Jamie in Anthony Minghella's Um Romance de Outro Mundo (1990) and the noble Colonel Brandon of Raz\u00e3o e Sensibilidade (1995). He treated audiences to his comedic abilities in such films as Dogma (1999), Her\u00f3is Fora de \u00d3rbita (1999) and O Guia do Mochileiro das Gal\u00e1xias (2005), and roles like Dr. Alfred Blalock in Quase Deuses (2004), and as Alex Hughes in Um Certo Olhar (2006), showcased his ability to play ordinary men in extraordinary situations. Rickman even conquered the daunting task of singing a role in a Stephen Sondheim musical as he took on the role of Judge Turpin in the movie adaptation of Sweeney Todd, o Barbeiro Demon\u00edaco da Rua Fleet (2007). In 2001, Rickman introduced himself to a whole new, younger generation of fans by taking on the role of Severus Snape in the film versions of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter e a Pedra Filosofal (2001). He continued to play the role through the eighth and last movie Harry Potter e as Rel\u00edquias da Morte - Parte 2 (2011).Alan Rickman died of pancreatic cancer on 14 January 2016. He was 69 years old.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Rosie Walker (walkerr@champmail.com)\n          \n\n", "realName": "Alan Sidney Patrick Rickman", "height": "185"},

Trained in ballet, her parents guided all of the children at one time or another into acting (which included Christopher (Kit), Terry and Candace Culkin). Bonnie herself attended Quintano School for Young Professionals in New York at one point and Bonnie and Kit went on to appear on the local stage and TV. Brother Kit would later be known more for siring a handful of talented child actors and/or stars (Macaulay Culkin, Kieran Culkin, and the rest).It was Bonnie who was first spotted among the other acting siblings by a talent scout who happened to catch her in a school production of \"Tom Sawyer\", and encouraged her. She made her professional debut at age 9 in a 1957 North Jersey Playhouse production of \"Dr. Praetorius\" and then was handed a full scholarship to study at George Balanchine's New York City Ballet. But the acting bug had bitten and after dancing in only four productions (including playing the role of Clara in \"The Nutcracker\"), she decided to hang up her ballet slippers. She proceeded to study at both the HB Studio and Actors Studio in New York.Bonnie nabbed a five-year role as young teen \"Sandy Porter\" in the New York-based daytime soap Love of Life (1951) starting in 1961. During that time, she took her first Broadway bow in \"Isle of Children\", a show that lasted but a week in March of 1962. She was also a replacement in the established hit comedy \"Enter Laughing\", a year later. After appearing in the stage play \"The Playroom\" in 1965, she earned strong reviews for her touching performance in \"My Sweet Charlie\", for which she won the 1967 Theatre World Award for \"promising new artist\". In it, she played a pregnant young Southern girl on the lam with a black lawyer. Patty Duke recreated the role a few years later on TV and captured an Emmy.Films beckoned at this point and Bonnie made her debut lending topnotch support in Os Paraquedistas Est\u00e3o Chegando (1969) which reunited A um Passo da Eternidade (1953) stars Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr. She earned even better marks in her next two films, one performance simply haunting and the other one hilarious. Once again playing pregnant and once again delivering a touching pathos, she played the dirt-poor marathon dancer who pitches songs for pennies and the almost-mother of Bruce Dern's child in the superb, award-winning, Depression-era drama A Noite dos Desesperados (1969). On the other end of the acting spectrum, she played the lovable bride-to-be in the side-splitting comedy classic As Mil Faces do Amor (1970).By this time, Bonnie had started concentrating on family values. She married scriptwriter Ken Luber on April 24, 1969, and bore him a son, Yuri, the following year. The time off to focus on motherhood (she had second son, Jonah Luber, in 1976) proved detrimental to her rising star. The remaining decade was uneventful at best, despite some fine showings in a splattering of TV-movies. Her big comeback came again on the movie trail in the early 1980s when she absolutely nailed the role of race car driver Shirley Muldowney in Dragster (1983). She was surprisingly overlooked at Oscar time, however, despite the praise she received. Despite respected work in subsequent movies such as As Violetas s\u00e3o Azuis (1986), O Pr\u00edncipe da Pensilv\u00e2nia (1988), Acima de Qualquer Suspeita (1990) and a running role as Bruce Willis's put-upon wife in Duro de Matar (1988) and its sequel, she found better and more frequent parts on TV. She found her niche in TV-movies with social themes and tugged at more hearts in Switched at Birth (1991), Tra\u00edda Pela Justi\u00e7a (1992), Any Mother's Son (1997) and To Live Again (1998).In a change of pace, Bonnie joined the ensemble cast of the low-budget cult comedy Uma Fam\u00edlia E Tanto (2000), as \"Latrelle\", a homophobic woman dealing with her mother's death, the imprisonment of her gay brother and her own son's \"coming out\". The movie has recently evolved into a TV series, which is scheduled for some time in 2008 and reunites her with original cast members Leslie Jordan and Olivia Newton-John.Divorced from the father of her two children, she is presently married to third husband (or fourth, depending on your source of reference) actor Michael MacRae, whom she married in 1995.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Gary Brumburgh / gr-home@pacbell.net\n          \n\n", "realName": "Bonnie Bedelia Culkin", "height": "163"},

He is of Pennsylvania Dutch (German), English, and Scottish ancestry, partly by way of Canada, where his mother was born. After several moves, his family settled in Danville, Illinois. Gene grew up in a broken home, which he left at the age of sixteen for a hitch with the US Marines. Moving to New York after being discharged, he worked in a number of menial jobs before studying journalism and television production on the G.I. Bill at the University of Illinois. Hackman would be over 30 years old when he finally decided to take his chance at acting by enrolling at the Pasadena Playhouse in California. Legend says that Hackman and friend Dustin Hoffman were voted \"least likely to succeed.\"Hackman next moved back to New York, where he worked in summer stock and off-Broadway. In 1964 he was cast as the young suitor in the Broadway play \"Any Wednesday.\" This role would lead to him being cast in the small role of Norman in Lilith (1964), starring Warren Beatty. When Beatty was casting for Bonnie e Clyde: Uma Rajada de Balas (1967), he cast Hackman as Buck Barrow, Clyde Barrow's brother. That role earned Hackman a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, an award for which he would again be nominated in Meu Pai, um Estranho (1970). In 1972 he won the Oscar for his role as Detective Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle in Opera\u00e7\u00e3o Fran\u00e7a (1971). At 40 years old Hackman was a Hollywood star whose work would rise to new heights with Um Lance no Escuro (1975) and O Risco de uma Decis\u00e3o (1975), or fall to new depths with O Destino do Poseidon (1972) and Eureka (1983). Hackman is a versatile actor who can play comedy (the blind man in O Jovem Frankenstein (1974)) or villainy (the evil Lex Luthor in Superman: O Filme (1978)). He is the doctor who puts his work above people in Medidas Extremas (1996) and the captain on the edge of nuclear destruction in Mar\u00e9 Vermelha (1995). After initially turning down the role of Little Bill Daggett in Clint Eastwood's Os Imperdo\u00e1veis (1992), Hackman finally accepted it, as its different slant on the western interested him. For his performance he won the Oscar and Golden Globe and decided that he wasn't tired of westerns after all.

He attended Crescent College, a Jesuit school, and was an excellent rugby player, with a strong passion for literature. Unfortunately, a bout of tuberculosis as a teenager ended his aspirations to a rugby career, but he became fascinated with the theater and skipped a local dance one night to attend a performance of \"Henry IV\". He was hooked and went on to learn his craft at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA), then spent several years in stage productions. He debuted on screen in De M\u00e3os Dadas com o Diabo (1959) and quickly scored regular work in films, including O Navio Condenado (1959), A Terrible Beauty (1960) and a good role as a frustrated Australian bomber pilot in Os Canh\u00f5es de Navarone (1961).However, his breakthrough performance was as the quintessential \"angry young man\" in the sensational drama O Pranto de um \u00cddolo (1963), which scored him an Oscar nomination. He then appeared in the WW II commando tale Os Her\u00f3is de Telemark (1965) and in the Sam Peckinpah-directed western Juramento de Vingan\u00e7a (1965). He next showed up in Hava\u00ed (1966) and played King Arthur in Camelot (1967), a lackluster adaptation of the famous Broadway play. Better performances followed, among them a role as a reluctant police informer in Ver-te-ei no Inferno (1970) alongside Sir Sean Connery. Harris took the lead role in the violent western Um Homem Chamado Cavalo (1970), which became something of a cult film and spawned two sequels. As the 1970s progressed, Harris continued to appear regularly on screen; however, the quality of the scripts varied from above average to woeful.His credits during this period included directing himself as an aging soccer player in Crep\u00fasculo de um \u00cddolo (1970); the western F\u00faria no Sangue (1973); the big-budget \"disaster\" film Juggernaut: Inferno em Alto-Mar (1974); the strangely-titled crime film At\u00e9 o \u00daltimo Disparo (1974); with Connery again in Robin E Marian (1976); Viagens de Gulliver (1977); a part in the Tubar\u00e3o (1975); Orca: A Baleia Assassina (1977) and a nice turn as an ill-fated mercenary with Richard Burton and Roger Moore in the popular action film Selvagens C\u00e3es de Guerra (1978).The 1980s kicked off with Harris appearing in the silly Bo Derek vanity production Tarzan, o Filho da Selva (1981) and the remainder of the decade had him appearing in some very forgettable productions. However, the luck of the Irish was once again to shine on Harris's career and he scored rave reviews (and another Oscar nomination) for Terra da Disc\u00f3rdia (1990). He then locked horns with Harrison Ford as an IRA sympathizer in Jogos Patri\u00f3ticos (1992) and got one of his best roles as gunfighter English Bob in the Clint Eastwood western Os Imperdo\u00e1veis (1992). Harris was firmly back in vogue and rewarded his fans with more wonderful performances in Recorda\u00e7\u00f5es (1993); Os Deserdados (1995); The Great Kandinsky (1995) and This Is the Sea (1997). Further fortune came his way with a strong performance in the blockbuster Gladiador (2000) and he became known to an entirely new generation of film fans as Albus Dumbledore in the mega-successful Harry Potter e a Pedra Filosofal (2001) and Harry Potter e a C\u00e2mara Secreta (2002). His final screen role was as \"Lucius Sulla\" in J\u00falio C\u00e9sar (2002).Harris died of Hodgkin's disease, also known as Hodgkin's lymphoma, in London on October 25, 2002, aged 72.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            firehouse44@hotmail.com/Rms125a@hotmail.com\n          \n\n", "realName": "Richard St. John Harris", "height": "183"},

After graduating, she had to decide whether to go to New York to pursue theater or Los Angeles to pursue film and television. She chose LA. Linda was cast in her first role, on the series Bone Chillers (1996). Her breakthrough part came when she was cast in Freaks & Geeks (1999). She played academic decathlete Lindsay Weir on the celebrated series, which won an Emmy Award in the Category of \"Outstanding Casting for a Comedy Series\".Cardellini captured the hearts of young girls, boys and teenagers, worldwide, for her portrayal of Velma in Warner Bros.'s Scooby-Doo (2002). She also co-starred in 'Brian Robbins'' A Guerra do Hamburguer (1997), Legalmente Loira (2001), with Reese Witherspoon, and Tom McLoughlin's No Limite do Sil\u00eancio (2001) with Andy Garcia, as well as in the Adam Sandler-produced comedy, Queridinho da Vov\u00f3 (2006).In 2005, Cardellini starred in the ensemble film, Pesadelo Americano (2005), for IFC Films, alongside Donald Sutherland, Forest Whitaker and Marcia Gay Harden. \"American Gun\" was the debut feature of director/co-writer Aric Avelino, which has earned a Best Picture nomination at the Independent Spirit Awards in 2007.

You can thank him later.Make no mistake: Maniscalco's is a meticulous, hard-won comedic point of view. Distinguished by the New York Times as having his \"own kind of panache,\" Maniscalco is a success story resulting from years of hard work and a keen self-awareness of innate talent. A natural born-storyteller, one constantly regaling his family with madcap tales at the dinner table, Maniscalco moved to Los Angeles in 1998 and began pounding the pavement on his comedic quest. The tireless worker first made his name at the city's famed Comedy Store where he performed at every opportunity -- even if that meant rushing over to the club on a break from his waiter job at the Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills.It's quite the understatement: Maniscalco now sits as one of the premier standup comedians. And a multi-faceted one at that: following a massive standup tour of theaters last year, the coming months are monumental ones for the 2016 Just for Laughs Stand Up Comedian of the Year. In addition to starring in his own wildly popular SiriusXM program, \"The Pete and Sebastian Show,\" Maniscalco will make several major motion picture appearances in the coming year. Notably, a voice-over role in the animated feature \"Nut Job 2,\" premiering this year; a role in the New Line Feature comedy \"The House\" starring Will Ferrell and Amy Poehler (directed by Andrew Cohen); and a turn in the independent drama \"Cruise\" directed by Rob Siegel and produced by Jeremy Renner.Still, for Maniscalco, the work continues.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Ebie McFarland, Essential Broadcast Media\n          \n\n", "realName": "Sebastian Joseph Maniscalco", "height": "175"},

She became one of the world's most enduring iconic figures and is remembered both for her winsome embodiment of the Hollywood sex symbol and her tragic personal and professional struggles within the film industry. Her life and death are still the subjects of much controversy and speculation. She was born Norma Jeane Mortenson at the Los Angeles County Hospital on June 1, 1926. Her mother Gladys Pearl Baker was a film-cutter at Consolidated Film Industries. Marilyn's father's identity was never known. Because Gladys was mentally and financially unable to care for young Marilyn, Gladys placed her in the care of a foster family, The Bolenders. Although the Bolender family wanted to adopt Marilyn, Gladys was eventually able to stabilize her lifestyle and took Marilyn back in her care when Marilyn was 7 years old. However, shortly after regaining custody of Marilyn, Gladys had a complete mental breakdown and was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic and was committed to a state mental hospital. Gladys spent the rest of her life going in and out of hospitals and rarely had contact with young Marilyn. Once Marilyn became an adult and celebrated as a film star, she paid a woman by the name of Inez Melson to look in on the institutionalized Gladys and give detailed reports of her progress. Gladys outlived her daughter, dying in 1984.Marilyn was then taken in by Gladys' best friend Grace Goddard, who, after a series of foster homes, placed Marilyn into the Los Angeles Orphan's Home in 1935. Marilyn was traumatized by her experience there despite the Orphan's Home being an adequate living facility. Grace Goddard eventually took Marilyn back to live with her in 1937 although this stay did not last long as Grace's husband began molesting Marilyn. Marilyn went to live with Grace's Aunt Ana after this incident, although due to Aunt Ana's advanced age she could not care properly for Marilyn. Marilyn once again for the third time had to return to live with the Goddards. The Goddards planned to relocated and according to law, could not take Marilyn with them. She only had two choices: return to the orphanage or get married. Marilyn was only 16 years old.She decided to marry a neighborhood friend named James Dougherty; he went into the military, she modeled, they divorced in 1946. She owned 400 books (including Tolstoy, Whitman, Milton), listened to Beethoven records, studied acting at the Actors' lab in Hollywood, and took literature courses at UCLA downtown. 20th Century Fox gave her a contract but let it lapse a year later. In 1948, Columbia gave her a six-month contract, turned her over to coach Natasha Lytess and featured her in the B movie Mentira Salvadora (1948) in which she sang three numbers : \"Every Baby Needs a Da Da Daddy\", \"Anyone Can Tell I Love You\" and \"The Ladies of the Chorus\" with Adele Jergens (dubbed by Virginia Rees) and others. Joseph L. Mankiewicz saw her in a small part in O Segredo das Joias (1950) and put her in A Malvada (1950), resulting in 20th Century re-signing her to a seven-year contract. Torrente de Paix\u00e3o (1953) and Os Homens Preferem as Louras (1953) launched her as a sex symbol superstar.When she went to a supper honoring her in the O Pecado Mora ao Lado (1955), she arrived in a red chiffon gown borrowed from the studio (she had never owned a gown). That same year, she married and divorced baseball great Joe DiMaggio (their wedding night was spent in Paso Robles, California). After O Pecado Mora ao Lado (1955), she wanted serious acting to replace the sexpot image and went to New York's Actors Studio. She worked with director Lee Strasberg and also underwent psychoanalysis to learn more about herself. Critics praised her transformation in Nunca Fui Santa (1956) and the press was stunned by her marriage to playwright Arthur Miller. True to form, she had no veil to match her beige wedding dress so she dyed one in coffee; he wore one of the two suits he owned. They went to England that fall where she made O Pr\u00edncipe Encantado (1957) with Laurence Olivier, fighting with him and falling further prey to alcohol and pills. Two miscarriages and gynecological surgery followed. So did an affair with Yves Montand. Work on her last picture Os Desajustados (1961), written for her by departing husband Miller was interrupted by exhaustion. She was dropped from the unfinished Something's Got to Give (1962) due to chronic lateness and drug dependency.On August 4, 1962, Marilyn Monroe's day began with threatening phone calls. Dr. Ralph Greenson, Marilyn's physician, came over the following day and quoted later in a document \"felt it was possible that Marilyn Monroe had felt rejected by some of the people she had been close to\". Apart from being upset that her publicist slept too long, she seemed fine. Pat Newcombe, who had stayed the previous night at Marilyn's house, left in the early evening as did Greenson who had a dinner date. Marilyn was upset he couldn't stay, and around 7:30pm she telephoned him while she was to tell him that her second husband's son had called him. Peter Lawford also called Marilyn, inviting her to dinner, but she declined. Lawford later said her speech was slurred. As the dark and depressing evening for Marilyn wore on there were other phone calls, including one from Jose Belanos, who said he thought she sounded fine. According to the funeral directors, Marilyn died sometime between 9:30pm and 11:30pm. Her maid unable to raise her but seeing a light under her locked door, called the police shortly after midnight. She also phoned Ralph Greenson who, on arrival, could not break down the bedroom door. He eventually broke in through French windows and found Marilyn dead in bed. The coroner stated she had died from acute barbiturate poisoning, and it was a 'probable suicide'.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Ed Stephan <stephan@cc.wwu.edu>\n          \n\n", "realName": "Norma Jeane Mortenson", "height": "166"},

Curtis himself admits that while he had almost no formal education, he was a student of the \"school of hard knocks\" and learned from a young age that the only person who ever had his back was himself, so he learned how to take care of both himself and younger brother, Julius. Curtis grew up in poverty, as his father, Emanuel, who worked as a tailor, had the sole responsibility of providing for his entire family on his meager income. This led to constant bickering between Curtis's parents over money, and Curtis began to go to movies as a way of briefly escaping the constant worries of poverty and other family problems. The financial strain of raising two children on a meager income became so tough that in 1935, Curtis's parents decided that their children would have a better life under the care of the state and briefly had Tony and his brother admitted to an orphanage. During this lonely time, the only companion Curtis had was his brother, Julius, and the two became inseparable as they struggled to get used to this new way of life. Weeks later, Curtis's parents came back to reclaim custody of Tony and his brother, but by then Curtis had learned one of life's toughest lessons: the only person you can count on is yourself.In 1938, shortly before Tony's Bar Mitzvah, tragedy struck when Tony lost the person most important to him when his brother, Julius, was hit by a truck and killed. After that tragedy, Curtis's parents became convinced that a formal education was the best way Tony could avoid the same never-knowing-where-your-next-meal-is-coming-from life that they had known. However, Tony rejected this because he felt that learning about literary classics and algebra wasn't going to advance him in life as much as some real hands-on life experience would. He was to find that real-life experience a few years later, when he enlisted in the navy in 1942. Tony spent over two years getting that life experience doing everything from working as a crewman on a submarine tender, the USS Proteus (AS-19), to honing his future craft as an actor performing as a sailor in a stage play at the Navy Signalman School in Illinois.In 1945, Curtis was honorably discharged from the navy, and when he realized that the GI Bill would allow him to go to acting school without paying for it, he now saw that his lifelong pipe dream of being an actor might actually be achievable. Curtis auditioned for the New York Dramatic Workshop, and after being accepted on the strength of his audition piece (a scene from \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\" in pantomime), Curtis enrolled in early 1947. He then began to pay his dues by appearing in a slew of stage productions, including \"Twelfth Night\" and \"Golden Boy\". He then connected with a small theatrical agent named Joyce Selznick, who was the niece of film producer David O. Selznick. After seeing his potential, Selznick arranged an interview for Curtis to see David O. Selznick at Universal Studios, where Curtis was offered a seven-year contract. After changing his name to what he saw as an elegant, mysterious moniker--\"Tony Curtis\" (named after the novel Adversidade (1936) by Hervey Allen and a cousin of his named Janush Kertiz)--Curtis began making a name for himself by appearing in small, offbeat roles in small-budget productions. His first notable performance was a two-minute role in Baixeza (1949), with Burt Lancaster, in which he makes Lancaster jealous by dancing with Yvonne De Carlo. This offbeat role resulted in Curtis's being typecast as a heavy for the next few years, such as playing a gang member in Almas Abandonadas (1949).Curtis continued to build up a show reel by accepting any paying job, acting in a number of bit-part roles for the next few years. It wasn't until late 1949 that he finally got the chance to demonstrate his acting flair, when he was cast in an important role in an action western, Serras Sangrentas (1950). On the strength of his performance in that movie, Curtis was finally cast in a big-budget movie, Winchester '73 (1950). While he appears in that movie only very briefly, it was a chance for him to act alongside a Hollywood legend, James Stewart.As his career developed, Curtis wanted to act in movies that had social relevance, ones that would challenge audiences, so he began to appear in such movies as Spartacus (1960) and Acorrentados (1958). He was advised against appearing as the subordinate sidekick in Spartacus (1960), playing second fiddle to the equally famous Kirk Douglas. However, Curtis saw no problem with this because the two had recently acted together in dual leading roles in Vikings, os Conquistadores (1958).\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            James Briggs.\n          \n\n", "realName": "Bernard Herschel Schwartz", "height": "175"},

He was born George Ranft, and was the son of Eva (Glockner) and Conrad Ranft, a department store deliveryman. His parents were both of German descent. In his youth, he showed a great interest in, and aptitude for, dancing. That, combined with his dark good looks and sharp dressing, made him a local favorite at such spots as the El Fey Club with Texas Guinan. In 1928, Raft went to Hollywood to try his luck at acting. His first big role was as the coin-tossing henchman in Scarface: A Vergonha de uma Na\u00e7\u00e3o (1932). His career was marked by numerous tough-guy roles, often a gangster or convict. The believability with which he played these, together with his lifelong associations with such real-life gangsters as Owney Madden and Bugsy Siegel, added to persistent rumors that he was also a gangster. The slightly shady reputation may have helped his popularity early on, but it made him somewhat undesirable to movie executives later in his career. He somewhat parodied his gangster reputation in Billy Wilder's Quanto Mais Quente Melhor (1959).\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Ken Yousten <kyousten@bev.net>\n          \n\n", "realName": "George Ranft", "height": "170"},

Over 25 years after his untimely death from mesothelioma in 1980, Steve McQueen is still considered hip and cool, and he endures as an icon of popular culture.McQueen was born in Beech Grove, Indiana, to Julia Ann (Crawford) and William Terence McQueen, a stunt pilot. His first lead role was in the low-budget sci-fi film A Bolha Assassina (1958), quickly followed by roles in Fac\u00ednoras Mascarados (1959) and Quando Explodem as Paix\u00f5es (1959). The young McQueen appeared as Vin, alongside Yul Brynner, in the star-laden Sete Homens e um Destino (1960) and effectively hijacked the lead from the bigger star by ensuring he was nearly always doing something in every shot he and Brynner were in together, such as adjusting his hat or gun belt. He next scored with audiences with two interesting performances, first in the World War II drama O Inferno \u00e9 para os Her\u00f3is (1962) and then in O Amante da Morte (1962). Riding a wave of popularity, McQueen delivered another crowd pleaser as Hilts, the Cooler King, in the knockout World War II P.O.W. film Fugindo do Inferno (1963), featuring his famous leap over the barbed wire on a motorcycle while being pursued by Nazi troops (in fact, however, the stunt was actually performed by his good friend, stunt rider Bud Ekins).McQueen next appeared in several films of mixed quality, including Quanto Vale um Homem (1963); O Pre\u00e7o de um Prazer (1963) and O G\u00eanio do Mal (1965). However, they failed to really grab audience attention, but his role as Eric Stoner in A Mesa do Diabo (1965), alongside screen legend Edward G. Robinson and Karl Malden, had movie fans filling theaters again to see the ice-cool McQueen they loved. He was back in another Western, Nevada Smith (1966), again with Malden, and then he gave what many consider to be his finest dramatic performance as loner US Navy sailor Jake Holman in the superb O Canhoneiro do Yang-Ts\u00e9 (1966). McQueen was genuine hot property and next appeared with Faye Dunaway in the provocative crime drama Crown, o Magn\u00edfico (1968), next in what many consider his signature role, that of a maverick, taciturn detective in the mega-hit Bullitt (1968), renowned for its famous chase sequence through San Francisco between McQueen's Ford Mustang and the killer's black Dodge Charger.Interestingly, McQueen's next role was a total departure from the action genre, as he played Southerner Boon Hogganbeck in the family-oriented Os Rebeldes (1969), based on the popular William Faulkner novel. Not surprisingly, the film didn't go over particularly well with audiences, even though it was an entertaining and well made production, and McQueen showed an interesting comedic side of his acting talents. He returned to more familiar territory, with the race film As 24 Horas de Le Mans (1971), a rather self-indulgent exercise, and its slow plot line contributed to its rather poor performance in theaters. It was not until many years later that it became something of a cult film, primarily because of the footage of Porsche 917s roaring around race tracks in France. McQueen then teamed up with maverick Hollywood director Sam Peckinpah to star in the modern Western Dez Segundos de Perigo (1972), about a family of rodeo riders, and again with Peckinpah as bank robber Doc McCoy in the violent Os Implac\u00e1veis (1972). Both did good business at the box office. McQueen's next role was a refreshing surprise and Papillon (1973), based on the Henri Charri\u00e8re novel of the same name, was well received by fans and critics alike. He plays a convict on a French penal colony in South America who persists in trying to escape from his captors and feels their wrath when his attempts fail.The 1970s is a decade remembered for a slew of \"disaster\" movies and McQueen starred in arguably the biggest of the time, Inferno na Torre (1974). He shared equal top billing with Paul Newman and an impressive line-up of co-stars including Fred Astaire, Robert Vaughn and Faye Dunaway. McQueen does not appear until roughly halfway into the film as San Francisco fire chief Mike O'Halloran, battling to extinguish an inferno in a 138-story skyscraper. The film was a monster hit and set the benchmark for other disaster movies that followed. However, it was McQueen's last film role for several years. After a four-year hiatus he surprised fans, and was almost unrecognizable under long hair and a beard, as a rabble-rousing early environmentalist in O Inimigo do Povo (1978), based on the Henrik Ibsen play.McQueen's last two film performances were in the unusual Western Tom Horn, O Cowboy (1980), then he portrayed real-life bounty hunter Ralph \"Papa' Thorson (Ralph Thorson) in Ca\u00e7ador Implac\u00e1vel (1980). In 1978, McQueen developed a small but persistent cough that would not go away. He quit smoking and underwent antibiotic treatments without improvement. Shortness of breath grew more pronounced and on December 22, 1979, after he completed work on 'The Hunter', a biopsy revealed pleural mesothelioma, a rare lung cancer associated with asbestos exposure for which there is no known cure. The asbestos was thought to have been in the protective suits worn in his race car driving days, but in fact the auto racing suits McQueen wore were made of Nomex, a DuPont fire-resistant aramid fiber that contains no asbestos. McQueen later gave a medical interview in which he believed that asbestos used in movie sound stage insulation and race-drivers' protective suits and helmets could have been involved, but he thought it more likely that his illness was a direct result of massive exposure while removing asbestos lagging from pipes aboard a troop ship while in the US Marines.By February 1980, there was evidence of widespread metastasis. While he tried to keep the condition a secret, the National Enquirer disclosed that he had \"terminal cancer\" on March 11, 1980. In July, McQueen traveled to Rosarito Beach, Mexico for an unconventional treatment after American doctors told him they could do nothing to prolong his life. Controversy arose over McQueen's Mexican trip, because McQueen sought a non-traditional cancer treatment called the Gerson Therapy that used coffee enemas, frequent washing with shampoos, daily injections of fluid containing live cells from cows and sheep, massage and laetrile, a supposedly \"natural\" anti-cancer drug available in Mexico, but not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. McQueen paid for these unconventional medical treatments by himself in cash payments which was said to have cost an upwards of $40,000 per month during his three-month stay in Mexico. McQueen was treated by William Donald Kelley, whose only medical license had been (until revoked in 1976) for orthodontics.McQueen returned to the United States in early October 1980. Despite metastasis of the cancer through McQueen's body, Kelley publicly announced that McQueen would be completely cured and return to normal life. McQueen's condition soon worsened and \"huge\" tumors developed in his abdomen. In late October, McQueen flew to Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico to have an abdominal tumor on his liver (weighing around five pounds) removed, despite warnings from his American doctors that the tumor was inoperable and his heart could not withstand the surgery. McQueen checked into a Juarez clinic under the alias \"Sam Shepard\" where the local Mexican doctors and staff at the small, low-income clinic were unaware of his actual identity.Steve McQueen passed away on November 7, 1980, at age 50 after the cancer surgery which was said to be successful. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered at sea. He married three times and had a lifelong love of motor racing, once remarking, \"Racing is life. Anything before or after is just waiting.\".\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            firehouse44@hotmail.com\n          \n\n", "realName": "Terrence Stephen McQueen", "height": "177"},

He dropped out of high school at 16 to join the Merchant Marines. He worked in a variety of jobs and received 2 Purple Hearts when he was wounded twice during the Korean War. He had his first chance to act when a friend got him a non-speaking role in the Broadway stage play \"The Caine Mutiny Court Martial (1954)\". Part of his work was to read lines to the lead actors and he began to learn the craft of acting. This play led to small television roles, television commercials and eventually a contract with Warner Brothers. Director David Butler saw something in Garner and gave him all the attention he needed when he appeared in Impulsos da Mocidade (1956). After co-starring in a handful of films during 1956-57, Warner Brothers gave Garner a co-starring role in the the western series Maverick (1957). Originally planned to alternate between Bart Maverick (Jack Kelly) and Bret Maverick (Garner), the show quickly turned into the Bret Maverick Show. As Maverick, Garner was cool, good-natured, likable and always ready to use his wits to get him in or out of trouble. The series was highly successful, and Garner continued in it into 1960 when he left the series in a dispute over money.In the early 1960s Garner returned to films, often playing the same type of character he had played on \"Maverick\". His successful films included Tempero do Amor (1963), Eu, Ela e a Outra (1963), Fugindo do Inferno (1963) and N\u00e3o Podes Comprar Meu Amor (1964). After that, his career wandered and when he appeared in the automobile racing movie Grand Prix (1966), he got the bug to race professionally. Soon, this ambition turned to supporting a racing team, not unlike what Paul Newman would do in later years.Garner found great success in the western comedy Uma Cidade Contra o Xerife (1969). He tried to repeat his success with a sequel, Latigo, o Pistoleiro (1971), but it wasn't up to the standards of the first one. After 11 years off the small screen, Garner returned to television in a role not unlike that in Uma Cidade Contra o Xerife (1969). The show was Nichols (1971) and he played the sheriff who would try to solve all problems with his wits and without gun play. When the show was canceled, Garner took the news by having Nichols shot dead, never to return in a sequel. In 1974 he got the role for which he will probably be best remembered, as wry private eye Jim Rockford in the classic Arquivo Confidencial (1974). This became his second major television hit, with Noah Beery Jr. and Stuart Margolin, and in 1977 he won an Emmy for his portrayal. However, a combination of injuries and the discovery that Universal Pictures' \"creative bookkeeping\" would not give him any of the huge profits the show generated soon soured him and the show ended in 1980. In the 1980s Garner appeared in few movies, but the ones he did make were darker than the likable Garner of old. These included Uma Fam\u00edlia em P\u00e9 de Guerra (1984) and O Romance de Murphy (1985). For the latter, he was nominated for both the Academy Award and a Golden Globe. Returning to the western mode, he co-starred with the young Bruce Willis in Assassinato em Hollywood (1988), a mythical story of Wyatt Earp, Tom Mix and 1920s Hollywood.In the 1990s Garner received rave reviews for his role in the acclaimed television movie about corporate greed, Selvagens em Wall Street (1993). After that he appeared in the theatrical remake of his old television series, Maverick (1994), opposite Mel Gibson. Most of his appearances after that were in numerous TV movies based upon Arquivo Confidencial (1974). His most recent films were Meus Queridos Presidentes (1996) and Cowboys do Espa\u00e7o (2000) .\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Tony Fontana < tony.fontana@spacebbs.com> and pchemoc389@rogers.com\n          \n\n", "realName": "James Scott Bumgarner", "height": "187"},

Attenborough was educated at Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys in Leicester and at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA).His film career began with a role as a deserting sailor in Nosso Barco, Nossa Alma (1942), a part that contributed to his being typecast for many years as a coward in films like London Belongs to Me (1948), Morning Departure (1950) and his breakthrough role as a psychopathic young gangster in the film adaptation of Graham Greene's novel, O Pior dos Pecados (1948). During World War II, Attenborough served in the Royal Air Force.He worked prolifically in British films for the next 30 years, and in the 1950s appeared in several successful comedies for John Boulting and Roy Boulting, including Private's Progress (1956) and Papai \u00e9 um Nudista (1959). Early in his stage career, Attenborough starred in the London West End production of Agatha Christie's \"The Mousetrap\", which went on to become one of the world's longest-running stage productions. Both he and his wife were among the original cast members of the production, which opened in 1952 and (as of 2007) is still running.In the 1960s, he expanded his range of character roles in films such as Farsa Diab\u00f3lica (1964) and Os Rifles de Batasi (1964), for which he won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of the regimental Sergeant Major. He appeared in the ensemble cast of Fugindo do Inferno (1963), as Squadron Leader \"Roger Bartlett\" (\"Big X\"), the head of the escape committee.In 1967 and 1968, he won back-to-back Golden Globe Awards in the category of Best Supporting Actor, the first time for O Canhoneiro do Yang-Ts\u00e9 (1966), starring Steve McQueen, and the second time for O Fabuloso Doutor Dolittle (1967), starring Rex Harrison. He would win another Golden Globe for Best Director, for Gandhi (1982), in 1983. Six years prior to \"Gandhi\", he played the ruthless \"Gen. Outram\" in Indian director Satyajit Ray's period piece, Os Jogadores do Fracasso (1977). He has never been nominated for an Academy Award in an acting category.He took no acting roles following his appearance in Otto Preminger's O Fator Humano (1979), until his appearance as the eccentric developer \"John Hammond\" in Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park: O Parque dos Dinossauros (1993). The following year, he starred as \"Kris Kringle\" in Milagre na Rua 34 (1994), a remake of the 1947 classic. Since then, he has made occasional appearances in supporting roles, including the historical drama, Elizabeth (1998), as \"Sir William Cecil\".In the late 1950s, Attenborough formed a production company, \"Beaver Films\", with Bryan Forbes and began to build a profile as a producer on projects, including Os Sete Cavalheiros do Diabo (1960), Momentos de Ang\u00fastia (1960) and Tamb\u00e9m o Vento Tem Segredos (1961), also appearing in the first two of these as an actor.His feature film directorial debut was the all-star screen version of the hit musical, Oh! Que Bela Guerra! (1969), and his acting appearances became more sporadic - the most notable being his portrayal of serial killer \"John Christie\" in O Estrangulador de Rillington Place (1971). He later directed two epic period films: As Garras do Le\u00e3o (1972), based on the early life of Winston Churchill, and Uma Ponte Longe Demais (1977), an all-star account of Operation Market Garden in World War II. He won the 1982 Academy Award for Directing for his historical epic, Gandhi (1982), a project he had been attempting to get made for many years. As the film's producer, he also won the Academy Award for Best Picture. His most recent films, as director and producer, include Chaplin (1992), starring Robert Downey Jr. as Charles Chaplin, and Terra das Sombras (1993), based on the relationship between C.S. Lewis and Joy Gresham. Both films starred Anthony Hopkins, who also appeared in three other films for Attenborough: \"Young Winston\", \"A Bridge Too Far\" and the thriller, Um Passe de M\u00e1gica (1978).Attenborough also directed the screen version of the hit Broadway musical, \"A Chorus Line\" (Chorus Line: Em Busca da Fama (1985)), and the apartheid drama, Um Grito de Liberdade (1987), based on the experiences of Donald Woods. He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Director for both films. His most recent film as director was another biographical film, O Guerreiro da Paz (1999), starring Pierce Brosnan.Attenborough is the President of RADA, Chairman of Capital Radio, President of BAFTA, President of the Gandhi Foundation, and President of the British National Film and Television School. He is also a vice patron of the Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund.He is also the patron of the UWC movement (United World Colleges), whereby he continually contributes greatly to the colleges that are part of the organization.

He also founded the \"Jane Holland Creative Center for Learning\" at Waterford Kamhlaba in Swaziland in memory of his daughter, who died in the Tsunami on Boxing Day, 2004. He passionately believes in education, primarily education that does not judge upon color, race, creed or religion. His attachment to Waterford is his passion for non-racial education, which were the grounds on which Waterford Kamhlaba was founded. Waterford was one of his inspirations for directing Um Grito de Liberdade (1987), based on the life of Steve Biko.He was elected to the post of Chancellor of the University of Sussex on 20 March 1998, replacing the Duke of Richmond and Gordon. A lifelong supporter of Chelsea Football Club, Attenborough served as a director of the club from 1969-1982 and, since 1993, has held the honorary position of Life Vice President.

His grandson, Samuel Holland, and granddaughter, Alice Holland, also read in the service.Attenborough's father was principal of University College, Leicester, now the city's university. This has resulted in a long association with the university, with Lord Attenborough a patron. A commemorative plaque was placed on the floor of Richmond Parish Church. The university's \"Richard Attenborough Centre for Disability and the Arts\", which opened in 1997, is named in his Honor.His son, Michael Attenborough, is also a director. He has two younger brothers, the famous naturalist Sir David Attenborough and John Attenborough, who has made a career in the motor trade.He has collected Pablo Picasso ceramics since the 1950s.

Her parents divorced when she was 10. She and her sister were raised by their mother. Her early interest was dance. To Bette, dancers led a glamorous life, but then she discovered the stage, and gave up dancing for acting. To her, it presented much more of a challenge.After graduation from Cushing Academy, she was refused admittance to Eva Le Gallienne's Manhattan Civic Repertory. She enrolled in John Murray Anderson's Dramatic School and was the star pupil. She was in the off-Broadway play \"The Earth Between\" (1923), and her Broadway debut in 1929 was in \"Broken Dishes\". She also appeared in \"Solid South\". Late in 1930, she was hired by Universal, where she made her first film, called Way Back Home (1931). When she arrived in Hollywood, the studio representative who went to meet her train left without her because he could find no one who looked like a movie star. An official at Universal complained she had \"as much sex appeal as Slim Summerville\" and her performance in Garota Rebelde (1931) didn't impress.In 1932, she signed a seven-year deal with Warner Brothers Pictures. Her first film with them was Filhos (1931). She became a star after her appearance in O Homem Deus (1932), known as the actress that could play a variety of very strong and complex roles. More fairly successful movies followed, but it was the role of Mildred Rogers in RKO's Escravos do Desejo (1934) that would give Bette major acclaim from the film critics. She had a significant number of write-in votes for the Best Actress Oscar, but didn't win. Warner Bros. felt their seven-year deal with Bette was more than justified. They had a genuine star on their hands. With this success under her belt, she began pushing for stronger and more meaningful roles. In 1935, she received her first Oscar for her role in Perigosa (1935) as Joyce Heath.In 1936, she was suspended without pay for turning down a role that she deemed unworthy of her talent. She went to England, where she had planned to make movies, but was stopped by Warner Bros. because she was still under contract to them. They did not want her to work anywhere. Although she sued to get out of her contract, she lost. Still, they began to take her more seriously after that.Returning after losing her lawsuit, her roles improved dramatically. In 1938, Bette received a second Academy Award nomination for her work in Jezebel (1938) opposite the soon-to-be-legendary Henry Fonda. The only role she didn't get that she wanted was Scarlett O'Hara in ...E o Vento Levou (1939). Warners wouldn't loan her to David O. Selznick unless he hired Errol Flynn to play Rhett Butler, which both Selznick and Davis thought was a terrible choice. It was rumored she had numerous affairs, among them George Brent and William Wyler, and she was married four times, three of which ended in divorce. She admitted her career always came first.She made many successful films in the 1940s, but each picture was weaker than the last and by the time her Warner Brothers contract had ended in 1949, she had been reduced to appearing in such films as the unintentionally hilarious A Filha de Satan\u00e1s (1949). She made a huge comeback in 1950 when she replaced an ill Claudette Colbert in, and received an Oscar nomination for, A Malvada (1950). She worked in films through the 1950s, but her career eventually came to a standstill, and in 1961 she placed a now famous Job Wanted ad in the trade papers.She received an Oscar nomination for her role as a demented former child star in O que Ter\u00e1 Acontecido a Baby Jane? (1962). This brought about a new round of super-stardom for generations of fans who were not familiar with her work. Two years later, she starred in Com a Maldade na Alma (1964). Bette was married four times.In 1977 she received the AFI's Lifetime Achievement Award and in 1979 she won a Best Actress Emmy for Duas Estranhas - Hist\u00f3ria de M\u00e3e e Filha (1979). In 1977-78 she moved from Connecticut to Los Angeles and filmed a pilot for the series Hotel (1983), which she called Brothel. She refused to do the TV series and suffered a stroke during this time.Her last marriage, to actor Gary Merrill, lasted ten years, longer than any of the previous three. In 1985, her daughter Barbara Davis (\"B.D.\") Hyman published a scandalous book about Bette called \"My Mother's Keeper.\" Bette worked in the later 1980s in films and TV, even though a stroke had impaired her appearance and mobility. She wrote a book, \"This 'N That\", during her recovery from the stroke. Her last book was \"Bette Davis, The Lonely Life\", issued in paperback in 1990. It included an update from 1962 to 1989. She wrote the last chapter in San Sebastian, Spain.Sadly, Bette Davis died on October 6, 1989, of metastasized breast cancer, in Neuilly-sur-Seine, Hauts-de-Seine, France. Many of her fans refused to believe she was gone.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Meredy <meredy@meredy.com> and Ed Stephan <stephan@cc.wwu.edu> and Denny Jackson\n          \n\n", "realName": "Ruth Elizabeth Davis", "height": "160"},

She was the daughter of a salesman and his wife, Catherine, who herself was the daughter of Frank Lloyd Wright, the world-renowned architect. Anne was a young girl of 11 when her parents moved to New York City, which at that time was still the hub of the entertainment industry even though the film colony was moving west. The move there encouraged her to consider acting as a vocation. By the time she was 13 she had already appeared in a stage production of 'Seen but Not Heard'and had garnered rave reviews from the tough Broadway critics. The play helped her gain entrance to an exclusive acting school. In 1937 Anne made her first foray into Hollywood to test the waters there in the film industry. As she was thought to be too young for a film career, she packed her bags and returned to the New York with her mother, where she continued to act in Broadway and summer stock up and down the East Coast. Undaunted by the failure of her previous effort to crack Hollywood, Anne returned to California two years later to try again. This time her luck was somewhat better. She took a screen test which was ultimately seen by the moguls of Twentieth Century-Fox and she was signed to a seven-year contract. However, before she could make a movie with Fox, Anne was loaned out to MGM to make Punhos de Ferro (1940). At only 17 years of age, she was already in the kind of pictures that other starlets would have had to slave for years as an extra before landing a meaty role. Back at Fox, that same year, Anne played Mary Maxwell in O Eterno Don Juan (1940), which was a box-office dud. The following year she played Amy Spettigue in the remake of A Tia de Carlitos (1941). It still wasn't a great role, but it was better than a bit part. The only other film job Anne appeared in that year was in O Segredo do P\u00e2ntano (1941). It was the first role that was really worth anything, but critics weren't that impressed with Anne, her role nor the movie. In 1942 Anne played Joseph Cotten's daughter, Lucy Morgan, in Soberba (1942). The following year she appeared in Estrela do Norte (1943), the first film where she received top billing. The film was a critical and financial success and Anne came in for her share of critical plaudits. A Hip\u00f3crita (1944) the next year was a dismal failure, but Um Sonho de Domingo (1944) was received much better by the public, though it was ripped apart by the critics. Anne starred with John Hodiak, who would become her first husband in 1947 (Anne was to divorce Hodiak in 1953. Her other two husbands were Randolph Galt and David Klee). In 1946 Anne portrayed Sophie MacDonald in O Fio da Navalha (1946), a film that would land her an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. She had come a long way in so short a time, but for her next two films she was just the narrator: ...E os Anos Passaram (1947) and Quatro Irm\u00e3os a Queriam (1947). It would be 1950 before she landed another decent role--the part of Eve Harrington in A Malvada (1950). This film garnered Anne her second nomination, but she lost the Oscar to Judy Holliday for Nascida Ontem (1950). After several films through the 1950s, Anne landed what many considered a plum role--Queen Nefretiri in Cecil B. DeMille's Os Dez Mandamentos (1956). Never in her Hollywood career did Anne look as beautiful as she did as the Egyptian queen, opposite Charlton Heston and Yul Brynner. After that epic, job offers got fewer because she wasn't tied to a studio, instead opting to freelance her talents. After no appearances in 1958, she made one film in 1959 O Amor de Sua Vida (1959) and one in 1960 Cimarron - Jornada da Vida (1960). After Pelos Bairros do V\u00edcio (1962), she took a hiatus from filming for the next four years. She was hardly idle, though. She appeared often on stage and on television. She wasn't particularly concerned with being a celebrity or a personality; she was more concerned with being just an actress and trying hard to produce the best performance she was capable of. After several notable TV appearances, Anne became a staple of two television series, East of Eden (1981) and Hotel (1983). Her final moment before the public eye was as Irene Adler in the TV film The Masks of Death (1984). On December 12, 1985, Anne died of a stroke in New York. She was 62.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Denny Jackson\n          \n\n", "realName": null, "height": "162"},

He became a dialoguist, then a screenwriter on numerous Paramount productions in Hollywood, most of them Jack Oakie vehicles. Still in his 20s, he produced first-class MGM films, including N\u00fapcias de Esc\u00e2ndalo (1940). Having left Metro after a dispute with studio chief Louis B. Mayer over Judy Garland, he then worked for Darryl F. Zanuck at 20th Century-Fox, producing As Chaves do Reino (1944), when Ernst Lubitsch's illness first brought him to the director's chair for O Solar de Dragonwyck (1946).

Her strict father was a factory worker, and her mother was a homemaker. She was the second of four children. At the age of 15, she studied in Saegertown High School, Pennsylvania, and at that same age, entered Edinboro State University of Pennsylvania, and graduated with a degree in creative writing and fine arts. She was a very smart girl (with an IQ of 154), became a bookworm, and once was told that a suitable job for her (and her brains) was to become a lawyer. However, her first love was still the black-and-white movies, especially those featuring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. So, the 17-year-old Sharon got herself into the Miss Crawford County and won the beauty contest.From working part-time as a McDonald's counter girl, she worked her way up to become a successful Ford model, both in TV commercials and print ads. In 1980, she made her acting debut in Woody Allen's Mem\u00f3rias (1980) as \"pretty girl in train\". Her first speaking part, though, was in Wes Craven's horror movie, Ben\u00e7\u00e3o Mortal (1981). She struggled through many parts in B-movies, notably As Minas do Rei Salom\u00e3o (1985) and Action Jackson (1988). She was also married in 1984 to Michael Greenburg, the producer of MacGyver - Profiss\u00e3o: Perigo (1985), but they divorced two years later.She finally got her big break with Arnold Schwarzenegger in O Vingador do Futuro (1990) and also posed nude for Playboy, a daring move for a 32-year-old actress. But it worked; she landed the breakthrough role as a sociopath novelist, \"Catherine Tramell\", in Instinto Selvagem (1992). Her interrogation scene has become a classic in film history and her performance captivated everyone, from MTV viewers, who honored her with Most Desirable Female and Best Female Performance Awards, to a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress. After she got famous, she didn't want to be typecast, so she played a victim in Invas\u00e3o de Privacidade (1993), and, in Intersection: Uma Escolha, uma Ren\u00fancia (1994), she was the aloof, estranged wife of Richard Gere. These movies didn't \"work,\" so she got herself again into more aggressive roles , such as O Especialista (1994) with Sylvester Stallone and R\u00e1pida e Mortal (1995) with Gene Hackman.But it wasn't until she played a beautiful but drug-crazy wife of Robert De Niro in Cassino (1995) that she got far more than just fame and fortune--she also received the acknowledgment of the movie industry for her acting ability. She received her first Golden Globe and an Oscar nomination. She did a couple of films afterwards, teaming up with Isabelle Adjani in Diabolique (1996), and as a woman waiting for her death penalty in A \u00daltima Chance (1996).

At 17, she appeared on the cover of an avant-garde Catalonian magazine and from there she began working in local theatre companies and on local Catalonian TV channels, including giving Catalan language classes on Canal 33. It was here where she caught the eye of Bigas Luna, which led to Lola (1986), her first film and, thus, her future was set. It was in 1991 that she became well-known in the film Amo tu cama rica (1992), a comedy with Javier Bardem, consolidated a year later in Fernando Trueba's romantic comedy Sedu\u00e7\u00e3o (1992), starring Pen\u00e9lope Cruz.

He was born outside of Barcelona in the seaside town of Villanova i la Geltr\u00fa on December 22nd, 1965. As a youth he was inclined towards the performance arts and headed to France for further studies in the field. In 1991 he auditioned for French director Manuel Poirier who was so impressed with Sergi that he gave him the lead role in \"Western.\" Poirier and L\u00f3pez continued to collaborate on \"La Petite-Amie d'Antonio,\" \"La Campagne,\" \"Attention Fragile,\" and \"Marion\" in subsequent years. Sergi often played the charming Spanish immigrant lost in France in Poirier's films.Sergi's career was actually cemented in France that catapulted him to public recognition, while Spain was still relatively oblivious to her talented son until 1997. In 1997 Sergi appeared in Catalan auteur Ventura Pons' \"Caricies\" that also showcased Spain's finest actors. He spoke Catalan in the role. After \"Caricies\" Sergi appeared in Spanish cinema more frequently such as in \"Entre las piernas\" with Spanish mega-stars Javier Bardem and Victoria Abril and in \"Lisboa\" with Spanish legend Carmen Maura. Sergi was then offered plum roles both in France and Spain and split time traveling back and forth between his adopted nation and native motherland.In 2001 he won the C\u00e9sar for his role in Dominick Moll's \"Harry, Un Ami Qui Vous Veut du Bien.\" This role came to define his mastery on villainous roles which continued in \"Solo Mia\" with Paz Vega as his battered wife, Stephen Frears' \"Dirty Pretty Things\" with Chiwetel Ejiofor and Audrey Tautou as his scared pawns, and Guillermo del Toro's \"El Laberinto del Fauno\" with post-Civil Spain as playground for his Vidal's sadism.However, not all is dark villainy in Sergi's most recognized and praised thespian filmography. Sergi also displayed his comedic talents in \"Hombre Felices\" and \"Janis et John.\"With such range, talent, and skill, it is no wonder horror master and aficionado Guillermo del Toro said he is \"in love\" with Sergi's work and insisted on casting him as the stone-cold killer Captain Vidal despite Spanish producers' misgivings. Let us hope that, despite wider international exposure, Sergi continues to retain his unique avant-gardeness and participate only in projects that do his talent justice.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            goofah\n          \n\n", "realName": "Sergi L\u00f3pez i Ayats", "height": "173"},

Cowboy hero Tim Holt avidly followed in the boots of his famous character-actor dad, the granite-jawed Jack Holt (b. Charles John Holt), who appeared in hundreds of silents and talkies (many of them westerns) over the years. The two actually appeared together as father and son in the western O Valente do Arizona (1948), and Jack was glimpsed (as a hobo in the Mexican flophouse that Humphrey Bogart, Walter Huston, and Tim were staying in) in the classic O Tesouro da Sierra Madre (1948). Also a part of the acting Holt clan was the beautiful \"prairie flower\" Jennifer Holt (nee Elizabeth Marshall Holt), Tim's younger sister, who appeared in scores of 1940s oaters. The three, however, never performed together in a single film.Tim was born Charles John Holt, Jr. in Beverly Hills on February 5, 1918, to Jack and his wife, Margaret Woods, at a time when Jack was just making a dent in silent films. Nicknamed \"Tim\", he was raised on his father's ranch in Fresno, where he performed outside chores and learned to ride a horse. Tim, in fact, made his debut at age 10 in one of his father's westerns, Fibra de Her\u00f3i (1928), based on a Zane Grey story. He played Jack's character as a young boy.The boyishly rugged, athletically inclined Tim attended military school in his teens, excelling in polo. While studying at college, he married his college sweetheart, Virginia Ashcroft, in 1938. At this point he decided to try to put together an acting career. Virginia herself made a very brief foray into acting.Tim apprenticed at various stock companies before he eased his way back into films with an unbilled part in A Hist\u00f3ria Come\u00e7ou \u00e0 Noite (1937). He then earned strong notices in the classic Barbara Stanwyck tearjerker Stella Dallas, M\u00e3e Redentora (1937) and as Olivia de Havilland's brother in Onde o Ouro Se Esconde (1938). His horseback riding capabilities and fast-drawing technique quickly kicked in with A Lei na Terra dos Bandoleiros (1938), and he joined a superb cast in John Ford's classic western No Tempo das Dilig\u00eancias (1939) as a by-the-book cavalry lieutenant.Hardly confined to westerns at this early stage, Tim showed impressive acting abilities in comedy (A Garota da Quinta Avenida (1939)), adventures (Robinson Su\u00ed\u00e7o (1940)), and high drama (Cora\u00e7\u00f5es Humanos (1941)), all for RKO Pictures. He reached an early peak when Orson Welles cast him against type as the cruel, malicious son George in Soberba (1942), a role Welles initially contemplated playing himself. By the mid '40s, however, Tim had settled into the western genre. He starred in a series of dusty RKO features partnered with comic Cliff Edwards by his side and also appeared solo elsewhere.World War II interrupted his thriving career. He was a decorated hero (Distinguished Flying Cross, Victory Medal, and Presidential Unit Citation among his awards) while serving in the Air Corps and was discharged with the rank of second lieutenant. Wounded over Tokyo on the last day of the war, he was also given the Purple Heart. He made an auspicious return to films in the role of Virgil Earp in Ford's Paix\u00e3o dos Fortes (1946) and then continued in a somewhat lesser vein with \"B\"-level oaters. He came to the forefront one more time, co-starring with gold prospecting rivals Humphrey Bogart and Walter Huston in John Huston's masterpiece O Tesouro da Sierra Madre (1948), arguably the high point of Tim's entire film career, which rightfully earned him the best notices he ever received.Richard Martin became his second sidekick in another popular string of RKO westerns, with Tim repeatedly making the \"top ten\" ranks of money-making cowboy stars. Appearing almost exclusively for RKO from 1939 on, Tim eventually became disillusioned with the quality of his pictures and decided to abandon films after appearing in RKO's Dilig\u00eancia Marcada (1952) while still a popular draw. Divorced from his second wife, Alice Harrison, he retired for the most part to his Oklahoma ranch with his third wife, Berdee Stephens, and their three children. He later became a manager for a radio station in Oklahoma City. In 1957 he came out of retirement to head up the cast in the subpar sci-fi horror film O Monstro que Desafiou o Mundo (1957) and then quickly returned to obscurity.Little was heard from Tim over the years save a co-starring role in a low-budget hillbilly moonshine extravaganza for exploitation king Herschell Gordon Lewis called This Stuff'll Kill Ya! (1971). He was diagnosed with bone cancer in August of 1972 and passed away rather quickly on February 15, 1973, shortly after his 54th birthday. Buried in Oklahoma, he was posthumously inducted into the Western Performers Hall of Fame in 1991 and was a recipient of the \"Golden Boot\" award in 1992.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Gary Brumburgh / gr-home@pacbell.net\n          \n\n", "realName": "Charles John Holt III", "height": "178"},

The ten-time Oscar-nominated legend was born John Marcellus Huston in Nevada, Missouri, on August 5, 1906. His ancestry was English, Scottish, Scots-Irish, distant German and very remote Portuguese. The age-old story goes that the small town of his birth was won by John's grandfather in a poker game. John's father was the equally magnanimous character actor Walter Huston, and his mother, Rhea Gore, was a newspaperwoman who traveled around the country looking for stories. The only child of the couple, John began performing on stage with his vaudevillian father at age 3. Upon his parents' divorce at age 7, the young boy would take turns traveling around the vaudeville circuit with his father and the country with his mother on reporting excursions. A frail and sickly child, he was once placed in a sanitarium due to both an enlarged heart and kidney ailment. Making a miraculous recovery, he quit school at age 14 to become a full-fledged boxer and eventually won the Amateur Lightweight Boxing Championship of California, winning 22 of 25 bouts. His trademark broken nose was the result of that robust activity.John married his high school sweetheart, Dorothy Harvey, and also took his first professional stage bow with a leading role off-Broadway entitled \"The Triumph of the Egg.\" He made his Broadway debut that same year with \"Ruint\" on April 7, 1925, and followed that with another Broadway show \"Adam Solitaire\" the following November. John soon grew restless with the confines of both his marriage and acting and abandoned both, taking a sojourn to Mexico where he became an officer in the cavalry and expert horseman while writing plays on the sly. Trying to control his wanderlust urges, he subsequently returned to America and attempted newspaper and magazine reporting work in New York by submitting short stories. He was even hired at one point by mogul Samuel Goldwyn Jr. as a screenwriter, but again he grew restless. During this time he also appeared unbilled in a few obligatory films. By 1932 John was on the move again and left for London and Paris where he studied painting and sketching. The promising artist became a homeless beggar during one harrowing point.Returning again to America in 1933, he played the title role in a production of \"Abraham Lincoln,\" only a few years after father Walter portrayed the part on film for D.W. Griffith. John made a new resolve to hone in on his obvious writing skills and began collaborating on a few scripts for Warner Brothers. He also married again. Warners was so impressed with his talents that he was signed on as both screenwriter and director for the Dashiell Hammett mystery yarn Rel\u00edquia Macabra (1941). The movie classic made a superstar out of Humphrey Bogart and is considered by critics and audiences alike--- 65 years after the fact--- to be the greatest detective film ever made. In the meantime John wrote/staged a couple of Broadway plays, and in the aftermath of his mammoth screen success directed bad-girl 'Bette Davis (I)' and good girl Olivia de Havilland in the film melodrama Nascida para o Mal (1942), and three of his \"Falcon\" stars (Bogart, Mary Astor and Sydney Greenstreet) in the romantic war picture Garras Amarelas (1942). During WWII John served as a Signal Corps lieutenant and went on to helm a number of film documentaries for the U.S. government including the controversial Let There Be Light (1946), which father Walter narrated. The end of WWII also saw the end of his second marriage. He married third wife Evelyn Keyes, of \"Gone With the Wind\" fame, in 1946 but it too lasted a relatively short time. That same year the impulsive and always unpredictable Huston directed Jean-Paul Sartre's experimental play \"No Exit\" on Broadway. The show was a box-office bust (running less than a month) but nevertheless earned the New York Drama Critics Award as \"best foreign play.\"Hollywood glory came to him again in association with Bogart and Warner Brothers'. O Tesouro da Sierra Madre (1948), a classic tale of gold, greed and man's inhumanity to man set in Mexico, won John Oscars for both director and screenplay and his father nabbed the \"Best Supporting Actor\" trophy. John can be glimpsed at the beginning of the movie in a cameo playing a tourist, but he wouldn't act again on film for a decade and a half. With the momentum in his favor, John hung around in Hollywood this time to write and/or direct some of the finest American cinema made including Paix\u00f5es em F\u00faria (1948) and Uma Aventura na \u00c1frica (1951) (both with Bogart), O Segredo das Joias (1950), A Gl\u00f3ria de um Covarde (1951) and Moulin Rouge (1952). Later films, including Moby Dick (1956), O Passado N\u00e3o Perdoa (1960), Os Desajustados (1961), Freud - Al\u00e9m da Alma (1962), A Noite do Iguana (1964) and A B\u00edblia (1966) were, for the most part, well-regarded but certainly not close to the level of his earlier revered work. He also experimented behind-the-camera with color effects and approached topics that most others would not even broach, including homosexuality and psychoanalysis.An ardent supporter of human rights, he, along with director William Wyler and others, dared to form the Committee for the First Amendment in 1947, which strove to undermine the House Un-American Activities Committee. Disgusted by the Hollywood blacklisting that was killing the careers of many talented folk, he moved to St. Clerans in Ireland and became a citizen there along with his fourth wife, ballet dancer Enrica (Ricki) Soma. The couple had two children, including daughter Anjelica Huston who went on to have an enviable Hollywood career of her own. Huston and wife Ricki split after a son (director Danny Huston) was born to another actress in 1962. They did not divorce, however, and remained estranged until her sudden death in 1969 in a car accident. John subsequently adopted his late wife's child from another union. The ever-impulsive Huston would move yet again to Mexico where he married (1972) and divorced (1977) his fifth and final wife, Celeste Shane.Huston returned to acting auspiciously with a major role in Otto Preminger's epic film O Cardeal (1963) for which Huston received an Oscar nomination at age 57. From that time forward, he would be glimpsed here and there in a number of colorful, baggy-eyed character roles in both good and bad (some positively abysmal) films that, at the very least, helped finance his passion projects. The former list included outstanding roles in Chinatown (1974) and O Vento e o Le\u00e3o (1975), while the latter comprised of hammy parts in such awful drek as Candy (1968) and Homem e Mulher At\u00e9 Certo Ponto (1970).Directing daughter Angelica in her inauspicious movie debut, the thoroughly mediocre Caminhando com o Amor e a Morte (1969), John made up for it 15 years later by directing her to Oscar glory in the mob tale A Honra do Poderoso Prizzi (1985). In the 1970s Huston resurged as a director of quality films with Cidade das Ilus\u00f5es (1972), O Homem que Queria ser Rei (1975) and Sangue Selvagem (1979). He ended his career on a high note with \u00c0 Sombra do Vulc\u00e3o (1984), the afore-mentioned A Honra do Poderoso Prizzi (1985) and Os Vivos e os Mortos (1987). His only certifiable misfire during that era was the elephantine musical version of Annie (1982), though it later became somewhat of a cult favorite among children.Huston lived the macho, outdoors life, unencumbered by convention or restrictions, and is often compared in style or flamboyancy to an Ernest Hemingway or Orson Welles. He was, in fact, the source of inspiration for Clint Eastwood in the helming of the film Cora\u00e7\u00e3o de Ca\u00e7ador (1990) which chronicled the making of \"The African Queen.\" Illness robbed Huston of a good portion of his twilight years with chronic emphysema the main culprit. As always, however, he continued to work tirelessly while hooked up to an oxygen machine if need be. At the end, the living legend was shooting an acting cameo in the film O El\u00e9trico Mr. North (1988) for his son Danny, making his directorial bow at the time. John became seriously ill with pneumonia and died while on location at the age of 81. This maverick of a man's man who was once called \"the eccentric's eccentric\" by Paul Newman, left an incredibly rich legacy of work to be enjoyed by film lovers for centuries to come.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Gary Brumburgh / gr-home@pacbell.net\n          \n\n", "realName": "John Marcellus Huston", "height": "188"},

At Ripon College he did well in the lead of \"The Truth\" and decided on acting as a career. In New York he roomed with O'Brien while they attended the Academy of Dramatic Arts. In 1923 they both got nonspeaking parts as robots in \"R.U.R\". In stock he supported himself with jobs as bellhop, janitor and salesman. John Ford saw his critically acclaimed performance in the lead role in the play \"The Last Mile\" and signed him to Up the River (1930) for Fox. Despite appearing in 16 films there over the next 5 years, Tracy never achieved star status there (during his stint the studio had floundered and was absorbed into Darryl F. Zanuck's 20th Century Pictures). In 1935 he signed with MGM under the aegis of Irving Thalberg and his career flourished. He became the first actor to win back-to-back Oscars for Marujo Intr\u00e9pido (1937) and in a project he initially didn't want to star in, Com os Bra\u00e7os Abertos (1938). He was nominated for S\u00e3o Francisco, a Cidade do Pecado (1936), O Papai da Noiva (1950), Conspira\u00e7\u00e3o do Sil\u00eancio (1955), O Velho e o Mar (1958), O Vento Ser\u00e1 Tua Heran\u00e7a (1960), Julgamento em Nuremberg (1961), and Adivinhe Quem vem para Jantar (1967). He had a brief romantic relationship with Loretta Young in the 1930s and a lifelong one with Katharine Hepburn beginning in 1942. His Catholic beliefs precluded ever divorcing his wife Louise, though they lived apart. Tracy suffered from severe alcoholism and diabetes (from the late 1940's), which unfortunately impacted his willingness to accept several tailor-made roles in films that would become big hits. Although his drinking problems were well known, he was inarguably considered one of the best actors in Hollywood among his peers (he had a well deserved reputation for keeping co-stars on their toes for his oddly endearing scene-stealing tricks) and remained in demand. A few weeks after completion of Stanley Kramer's Adivinhe Quem vem para Jantar (1967), during which he suffered from lung congestion, he died of a heart attack.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Ed Stephan <stephan@cc.wwu.edu>\n          \n\n", "realName": "Spencer Bonaventure Tracy", "height": "177"},

With fellow post-War stars Kirk Douglas and Robert Mitchum, Widmark brought a new kind of character to the screen in his character leads and supporting parts: a hardboiled type who does not actively court the sympathy of the audience. Widmark was not afraid to play deeply troubled, deeply conflicted, or just down right deeply corrupt characters.After his debut, Widmark would work steadily until he retired at the age of 76 in 1990, primarily as a character lead. His stardom would peak around the time he played the U.S. prosecutor in Julgamento em Nuremberg (1961) as the 1950s segued into the 1960s, but he would continue to act for another 30 years.Richard Weedt Widmark was born in Sunrise Township, Minnesota, to Ethel Mae (Barr) and Carl Henry Widmark. His father was of Swedish descent and his mother of English and Scottish ancestry. He has said that he loved the movies from his boyhood, claiming \"I've been a movie bug since I was 4. My grandmother used to take me\". The teen-aged Widmark continued to go to the movies, and was thrilled by Dr\u00e1cula (1931) and Frankenstein (1931). \"I thought Boris Karloff was great\", Widmark said. Although he loved the movies and excelled at public speaking while attending high school, Widmark attended Lake Forest College with the idea of becoming a lawyer. However, he won the lead role in a college production of, fittingly enough, the play \"Consellor-at-Law\", and the acting bug bit deep. After taking his bachelor of arts degree in 1936, he stayed on at Lake Forest as the Assistant Director of Speech and Drama. However, he soon quit the job and moved to New York to become an actor and, by 1938, he was appearing on radio in \"Aunt Jenny's Real Life Stories\". He made his Broadway debut in 1943 in the play \"Kiss and Tell\", and continued to appear on stage in roles that were light years away from the tough cookies he would play in his early movies.After World War II, he was signed by 20th Century Fox to a seven-year contract. After seeing his screen-test for the role of \"Tommy Udo\", 20th Century Fox boss Darryl F. Zanuck insisted that the slight, blonde Widmark - no one's idea of a heavy, particularly after his stage work - be cast as the psychopath in O Beijo da Morte (1947), which had been prepared as a Victor Mature vehicle. Even though the role was small, Widmark stole the picture. 20th Century Fox's publicity department recommended that exhibitors market the film by concentrating on thumbing the tub for their new anti-hero. \"Sell Richard Widmark\" advised the studio's publicity manual that an alert 20th Century Fox sent to theater owners. The manual told local exhibitors to engage a job-printer to have \"Wanted\" posters featuring Widmark's face to be printed and pasted up. He won a Golden Globe and an Oscar nod for the part, which lead to an early bout with typecasting at the studio. Widmark played psychotics in A Rua Sem Nome (1948) and A Taverna do Caminho (1948), and held his own against new Fox superstar Gregory Peck in the William A. Wellman's Western, C\u00e9u Amarelo (1948), playing the villain, of course. When he finally pressured the studio to let him play other parts, his appearance as a sailor in Capit\u00e3es do Mar (1949) made headlines: \"Life\" magazine's March 28, 1949 issue featured a three-page spread of the movie, headlined, \"Widmark the Movie Villain Goes Straight\". He was popular, having captured the public imagination, and before the decade was out, his hand and footprints were immortalized in concrete in the court outside Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood.The great director Elia Kazan cast Widmark in his thriller P\u00e2nico nas Ruas (1950) not as the heavy - that role went to Jack Palance - but as the physician who tracks down Palance, who has the plague, in tandem with detective Paul Douglas. Widmark was establishing himself as a real presence in the genre that later would be hailed as \"film noir\". Having proved he could handle other roles, Widmark didn't shy away from playing heavies in quality pictures. The soon-to-be-blacklisted director Jules Dassin cast him in one of his greatest roles, as the penny-ante hustler \"Harry Fabian\" in Sombras do Mal (1950). Set in London, Widmark's Fabian manages to survive in the jungle of the English demimonde, but is doomed. Widmark was masterful in conveying the desperation of the criminal seeking to control his own fate but who is damned, and this performance also became an icon of film noir. In that same year, he appeared in Oscar-winning writer-director Joseph L. Mankiewicz's O \u00d3dio \u00e9 Cego (1950) as a bigot who instigates a race riot.As the 1950s progressed, Widmark played in Westerns, military vehicles, and his old stand-by genre, the thriller. He appeared with Marilyn Monroe (this time cast as the psycho) in Almas Desesperadas (1952) and made Anjo do Mal (1953) that same year for director Samuel Fuller. His seven-year contract at Fox was expiring, and Zanuck - who would not renew the deal - cast him in the Western Lan\u00e7a Partida (1954) in a decidedly supporting role, billed beneath not only Spencer Tracy but even Robert Wagner and Jean Peters. The film was well-respected, and it won an Oscar nomination for best screenplay for the front of Hollywood 10 blacklistee Albert Maltz. Widmark left Fox for the life of a freelance, forming his own company, \"Heath Productions\". He appeared in more Westerns, adventures and social dramas, and pushed himself as an actor by taking the thankless role of \"The Dauphin\" in Otto Preminger's adaptation of George Bernard Shaw's Santa Joana (1957), a notorious flop that didn't bring anyone any honors, neither Preminger, his leading lady Jean Seberg or Widmark. In 1960, he was appearing in another notorious production, John Wayne's ode to suicidal patriotism, O \u00c1lamo (1960), with the personally liberal Widmark playing \"Jim Bowie\" in support of the very-conservative Wayne's \"Davy Crockett\". Along with character actor Chill Wills, Widmark arguably was the best thing in the movie.In 1961, Widmark acquitted himself quite well as the prosecutor in producer-director Stanley Kramer's Julgamento em Nuremberg (1961), appearing with the Oscar-nominated Spencer Tracy and the Oscar-winning Maximilian Schell, as well as with superstar Burt Lancaster and acting genius Montgomery Clift and the legendary 'Judy Garland' (the latter two winning Oscar nods for their small roles). Despite being showcased with all this thespian-firepower, Widmark's character proved to be the axis on which the drama turned. A little later, Widmark appeared in two Westerns directed by the great John Ford, with co-star James Stewart in Terra Bruta (1961) and as the top star in Ford's apologia for Indian genocide, Crep\u00fasculo de Uma Ra\u00e7a (1964). On Terra Bruta (1961), Ford feuded with Jimmy Stewart over his hat. Stewart insisted on wearing the same hat he had for a decade of highly successful Westerns that had made him one of the top box office stars of the 1950s. Both he and Widmark were hard-of-hearing (as well as balding and in need of help from the makeup department's wig-makers), so Ford would sit himself far away from them while directing scenes and then give them directions in a barely audible voice. When neither one of the stars could hear their director, Ford theatrically announced to his crew, that after over 40 years in the business, he was reduced to directing two deaf toupees. It was testimony to the stature of both Stewart and Widmark as stars that this was as far as Ford's baiting went, as the great director could be extraordinarily cruel.Widmark continued to co-star in A-pictures through the 1960s. He capped off the decade with one of his finest performances, as the amoral police detective in Don Siegel's gritty cop melodrama Os Impiedosos (1968). Watching \"Madigan\", one can see Widmark's characters as a progression in the evolution of what would become the late 1960s nihilistic anti-hero, such as those embodied by Clint Eastwood in Siegel's later Perseguidor Implac\u00e1vel (1971). Im the 1970s, he continued to make his mark in movies and, beginning in 1971, in television. In movies, he appeared primarily in supporting roles, albeit in highly billed fashion, in such films as Sidney Lumet's Assassinato no Expresso Oriente (1974), Robert Aldrich's O \u00daltimo Clar\u00e3o do Crep\u00fasculo (1977), and Stanley Kramer's As Pedras do Domin\u00f3 (1977). He even came back as a heavy, playing the villainous doctor in Coma (1978).In 1971, in search of better roles, he turned to television, starring as the President of the U.S. in the TV movies Vanished (1971). His performance in the role brought Widmark an Emmy nomination. He resurrected the character of \"Madigan\" for NBC, in six 90-minute episodes that appeared as part of the rotation of \"NBC Wednesday Mystery Movie\" for the Fall 1972 season. Widmark was married for 55 years to playwright Jean Hazlewood, from 1942 until her death in 1997 (they had one child, Anne, who was born in 1945). He lived quietly and avoided the press, saying in 1971, \"I think a performer should do his work and then shut up\". \"Los Angeles Times\" critic Kevin Thomas thought that Widmark should have won an Oscar nomination for his turn in Quando Morrem as Lendas (1972), playing a former rodeo star tutoring 'Frederic Forrest'.It is surprising to think that O Beijo da Morte (1947) represented his sole Oscar nomination, but with the rise of the respect for film noir around the time his career began tapering off in 70s, he began to be reevaluated as an actor. Unlike Bogart, who did not live to see his reputation flourish after his death, well before he retired, Widmark became a cult figure.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Martin Lewison and Jon C.

She was adopted by Canadian-born parents, Noreen Eloise (Nickleson), a nurse from Ontario, and The Rev. Vernon Weir McDormand, a Disciples of Christ minister from Nova Scotia, who raised her in the suburbs of Pittsburgh. She earned her B.A. in Theater from Bethany College in 1979 and her MFA from Yale in 1982. Her career after graduation began onstage, and she has retained her association with the theater throughout her career. She soon obtained prominent roles in movies as well, first starring in Gosto de Sangue (1984), in which she worked with filmmaker Joel Coen, whom she married that year. She frequently collaborated with Coen and his brother Ethan Coen in their films.McDormand's skilled and versatile acting has been recognized by both the critics and the Academy and, in addition to many critics' awards, she has been nominated for an Academy Award five times - Supporting in Mississippi em Chamas (1988), Quase Famosos (2000), and Terra Fria (2005), and Lead in Fargo: Uma Com\u00e9dia de Erros (1996) and Tr\u00eas An\u00fancios para um Crime (2017), winning the Oscar for the latter two. Keenly intelligent and possessed of a sharp wit, McDormand is the antithesis of the Hollywood starlet - rather than making every role about Frances McDormand, she dissolves into the characters she plays. Accordingly, she has expressed some reservations about the iconic recognition she has gained from her touching and amusing portrayal of Police Chief Marge Gunderson, the quintessential Minnesota Scandinavian, in Fargo: Uma Com\u00e9dia de Erros (1996).McDormand and Coen adopted a son, Pedro McDormand Coen, who was born in Paraguay, in 1994.

He grew up in Lebanon, Ohio, where his mother was from. After receiving degrees in theater arts and English from Hanover College, he had a brief stint in New York theater. He was soon cast as Woody on TV series Cheers (1982), which wound up being one of the most-popular TV shows ever and also earned Harrelson an Emmy for his performance in 1989.While he dabbled in film during his time on Cheers (1982), that area of his career didn't fully take off until towards the end of the show's run. In 1991, Dr. Hollywood: Uma Receita de Amor (1991) gave him his first widely-seen movie role, and he followed that up with Homens Brancos N\u00e3o Sabem Enterrar (1992), Proposta Indecente (1993) and Assassinos por Natureza (1994).

Harrelson is set to reprise that role for the sequels, which are scheduled for release in November 2013, 2014 and 2015. Harrelson has received two Academy Award nominations, first for his role as controversial Hustler founder Larry Flynt in O Povo Contra Larry Flint (1996) and then for a role in O Mensageiro (2009). He also received Golden Globe nominations for both of these parts. In 2016, he had a stand-out role as a wise teacher in the teen drama Quase 18 (2016).Harrelson was briefly married to Nancy Simon in the 80s, and later married his former assistant, Laura Louie, with whom he has three daughters.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Anonymous and Anne-Marie Cowsill\n          \n\n", "realName": "Woodrow Tracy Harrelson", "height": "177"},

The family moved to New York when he was two years old, living first in the Bronx and later in Manhattan. When Sam was five years old, his parents separated, at which point he and his father moved to San Francisco, where he subsequently grew up, while summers and other times were spent with his mother in New York.He made his acting debut when he was ten years old, alongside his mother, and later attended J Eugene McAteer High School in a program called SOTA. While still in high school, he got his first big break when he appeared in the independent film M\u00e1scaras do Terror (1989). The plot revolved around three escaped mental patients who dressed up as clowns and terrorized three brothers home alone--Sam played the eldest of the brothers. His next big break was supposed to have come when he was slated to star in a short-lived NBC TV-series called Dream Street (1989), but he was soon fired.After graduating from high school, Sam returned to New York for good and for two years he had private training at the William Esper Acting Studio. During this period he appeared in a variety of roles, such as the ABC Afterschool Specials (1972): Over the Limit (1990) (TV) and HBO's Lifestories: Families in Crisis (1992): Dead Drunk: The Kevin Tunell Story (Season 1 Episode 7: 15 March 1993); the head thug in As Tartarugas Ninja (1990); and a guest-star turn in an Emmy Award-winning episode of Lei & Ordem (1990), while working a string of regular day jobs and performing in plays.In 1994, a Miller Ice beer commercial finally enabled him to quit his other jobs to concentrate on his acting career, which culminated in him having five movies out by 1996: Basquiat - Tra\u00e7os de Uma Vida (1996); The Search for One-eye Jimmy (1994); Tempo de Mudan\u00e7a (1995); Mercy (1995); and A Caixa do Luar (1996). It was the latter film that would prove to be his real break-out in the industry. In Tom DiCillo's film, he found himself playing an eccentric named the Kid, a man-child living in a half-built mobile home in the middle of nowhere with a penchant for dressing like Davy Crockett, who manages to bring some much-needed chaos into the life of an electrical engineer played by John Turturro. The movie was not a box-office success, but it managed to generate a great deal of critical acclaim for itself and Sam.In 1997, he found himself the star of another critically lauded film, Inoc\u00eancia Rebelde (1997). Once again, he portrayed a societal outcast as Trent, a working-class man living in a trailer, earning a living mowing lawns inside a wealthy, gated Kentucky community. Trent soon finds himself befriended by 10-year-old Devon (Mischa Barton), and the movie deals with the difficulties in their friendship and the outside world. He also gave strong performances in the quirky independent comedy Ladr\u00f5es de Cofre (1998), in which he plays one half of a pretty awful singing duo (the other half being played by Steve Zahn) that gets mistaken for two safecrackers by Jewish gangsters; and the offbeat hitman trainee in Jerry and Tom (1998) against Joe Mantegna.After a few smaller appearances in films such as Woody Allen's Celebridades (1998) and the modern version of Sonho de uma Noite de Ver\u00e3o (1999), in which he played Francis Flute, he had larger roles in two of the bigger hit movies to emerge: \u00c0 Espera de um Milagre (1999) and Her\u00f3is Fora de \u00d3rbita (1999), wowing audiences and critics alike with his chameleon-like performances as a crazed killer in the former and a goofy actor in the latter.More recently, he appeared in another string of mainstream films, most notably as Eric Knox in As Panteras (2000) and as Zaphod Beeblebrox in O Guia do Mochileiro das Gal\u00e1xias (2005), while continuing to perform in smaller independent movies. After more than ten years in the business, Sam has earned his success. In 2018, he won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor as a troubled police deputy in Tr\u00eas An\u00fancios para um Crime (2017).\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            van_whistler@hotmail.co.uk, Zapti\n          \n\n", "realName": "Sam Rockwell", "height": "173"},

He was born in Sivas, Turkey in 1945. He graduated from Ankara State Conservatory in 1970, and his stage career started with the play \"Murat IV\". He is one of the most impressive performers in Turkish film and television thanks to his charismatic acting and his distinctive voice. In the successful TV drama \"Karadayi\" (2012-2015) he captured the hearts of the viewers with his inimitable readings of famous poems. During his long career he gave classes about stage and diction at the State Conservatory of Haceteppe University and the Theater Department of Bilkent University. Younger actors often refer to him as \"Cetin hoca\" (teacher).Tekindor became famous after he starred in the TV drama \"K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Aga\", directed by Y\u00fccel \u00c7akmak in 1983. In 1978 he was awarded \"best actor\" for his work in the play \"Gen\u00e7 Werther'in Acilari\" by the Ankara Art Association. His first film work was \"Ka\u00e7amak\" (The Love Affair) (1987), in which he acted with Basar Sabuncu and M\u00fcjde Ar. Over the years took roles and starred in many TV dramas such as \"D\u00f6neme\u00e7\" (The Turn) (1988), \"\u00d6nce Canan\" (1988), \"Son T\u00fcrbedar\" (1996), \"Kerem\" (1999), \"Yilan Hikayesi\" (1999), \"Tutku \u00c7emberi\" (2000), \"\u00dczg\u00fcn\u00fcm Leyla\" (2002), \"\u00c7aylak\" (2003), \"Bir Istanbul Masali\" (An Istanbul Tale) (2003), \"Seytan Ayrintida Gizlidir\" (Satan Is Hidden In Details) (2004), \"\u00d6d\u00fcn\u00e7 Hayat\" (Borrowed Life) (2005), \"Kabuslar Evi-Hayal-i Cihan\" (House Of Nightmares: The dream of Cihan) (2006), \"Asi\" (2007), \"Bir \u00c7ocuk Sevdim\" (I Loved a Girl) (2011), \"Karadayi\" (2012), \"I\u00e7erde\" (Inside) (2016) and in films like \"Yavrularim\" (My Babies) (1984), \"Ka\u00e7amak\" (The Love Affair) (1987), \"Karsilasma\" (Encounter) (2002), \"Babam ve Oglum\" (My Father and My Son) (2005), \"Ilk Ask\" (First Love) (2006), \"Ulak\" (The Messenger) (2007), \"Av Mevsimi\" (Hunting Season) (2010), \"Dedemin Insanlari\" (My Grandfather's People) (2011), \"Babam\" (My Father) (2017). In 1987 Tekindor received an award for \"best actor\" from the Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism and the Ankara Art Association. He was also awarded \"best actor\" by the Ankara Art Association in 1999. He stopped giving any kind of interviews in the 80's because he found himself in an awkward situation after a journalist wrote things he had never said, and he hasn't given any interview ever since. During the 90's he almost stayed away from any acting in film and television. He stayed in Ankara and kept on his stage work, teaching and voice overs. As well as a stage, TV and film actor, he is also very famous for his iconic voice and his voice dubbing work, which by that time was more than his work in front of the camera. This changed when a journalist wrote in an article: \"What ever film or TV series we watch there is always the voice of Cetin Tekindor. I think he earned him self enough money to go on vacation and leave us alone for a bit\". Tekindor considers this as the greatest gift that was ever given to him, because it made him realize that it was about time for a turn in his career. This game changing turn brought several awards and some of the greatest performances in Turkish film and television. In 2003, for his work as Mahmut in the film \"Karsilasma\"(Encounter) he received the \"best actor\" award in the Ankara Film Festival and the \"best supporting actor\" in the Sadri Alisik Awards. In 2005, Tekindor starred in \u00c7agan Irmak's film \"Babam ve Oglum\" (My Father and My Son) and received the \"best actor\" award in both the 13th \u00c7ASOD Awards and the 27th SIYAD Turkish Film Awards. His monologue in the middle of the street near the end of the movie, which was shot in only one take, is considered to be one of the most powerful, heartbreaking and unforgettable scenes/performances in Turkish film history. In 2008 working again with director \u00c7agan Irmak in the film \"Ulak\" (The Messenger) brought him the \"best male film actor\" award in the 2008 Ismail D\u00fcmb\u00fcll\u00fc Awards. In 2009, he was awarded \"best actor\" by T\u00dcRSAK. Despite his successful career and recognition he always keeps a low profile with no celebrity behavior. He stays away from the spot lights and avoids any self promoting action, focusing only on his work.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Elekiah Wisemiller\n          \n\n", "realName": null, "height": null},

An overwrought turn in the disastrous biopic Mam\u00e3ezinha Querida (1981) effectively derailed her career - but, at the same time, made her a bit of a camp favorite in the gay community - though she's been given infrequent opportunities worthy of her talent since that unfortunate halt.Born prematurely on Jan. 14, 1941 in Bascom, FL, Dorothy Faye Dunaway was the daughter of MacDowell Dunaway, Jr., a career Army officer, and his wife, Grace April Smith. After a stint as a teenaged beauty queen in Florida, she intended to pursue education at the University of Florida, but switched to acting, earning her degree from Boston University in 1962. She was given the enviable task of choosing between a Fulbright Scholarship to the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts or a role in the Broadway production of \"A Man For All Seasons\" as a member of the American National Theatre and Academy. She picked the latter, enjoying a fruitful stage career for the next two years, which was capped by appearances in \"After the Fall\" and \"Hogan's Goat.\" The latter - an off-Broadway production in 1967 - required Dunaway to tumble down a flight of steps in every performance, earning her a screen debut in the wan counterculture comedy Acontece Cada Coisa (1967). Just five months after its release, however, she was wowing audiences across the country as Depression-era bank robber Bonnie Parker in Arthur Penn's controversial Bonnie e Clyde: Uma Rajada de Balas (1967). Her turn as the na\u00efve but trigger-happy and sexually aggressive Parker earned her Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations, and provided a direct route to the front of the line for Hollywood leading ladies in an unbelievably short amount of time.Dunaway followed this success with another hit, Crown, o Magn\u00edfico (1968), in which her coolly sensual insurance investigator generated considerable sparks with playboy and jewel thief Steve McQueen. She then bounced between arthouse efforts like Confiss\u00f5es de uma Modelo (1970), directed by her ex-boyfriend, photographer Jerry Schatzberg, and the revisionist Western O Massacre dos Pistoleiros (1971), as well as big-budget efforts like O Pequeno Grande Homem (1970), which cast her as a predatory preacher's wife with designs on Dustin Hoffman's reluctant Native American hero. Dunaway also balanced these projects with several well-regarded theatrical productions, including a 1972-73 stint as Blanche Du Bois in \"A Streetcar Named Desire,\" and notable TV-movies like The Woman I Love (1972), which cast her as the Duchess of Windsor, and TV broadcasts of Great Performances: Hogan's Goat (1971) and After the Fall (1974). But her turn as the duplicitous Lady De Winter in Richard Lester's splashy, slapstick take on Os Tr\u00eas Mosqueteiros (1973) and its 1974 sequel A Vingan\u00e7a de Milady (1974) preceded a long period of critical and box office hits, starting with her masterful performance in 1974's Chinatown (1974).Dunaway's turn as Evelyn Mulwray, the mysterious woman who draws detective Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson) into a dark and complicated web of murder, incest and catastrophic business deals, seemed the epitome of every femme fatale to ever stride across a chiaroscuro-lit scene in classic noir. But Dunaway also found the horribly wounded core of her character as well, and turned Evelyn from a pastiche to a full-blown and emotionally resonant human being. Critics and award groups rushed to nominate Dunaway for the role, and she netted her second Academy Award nod, as well as Golden Globe and BAFTA nominations. Dunaway had fought hard for her performance - her battles with director Roman Polanski were no secret - but sadly, she lost the Oscar to Ellen Burstyn for Alice N\u00e3o Mora Mais Aqui (1974). However, it would be Dunaway's performance which stood the test of time.High-gloss turns in Inferno na Torre (1974) and Sydney Pollack's political thriller Tr\u00eas Dias do Condor (1975) preceded one of her best television performances; that of Depression-era radio preacher Aimee Semple MacPherson in O Desaparecimento de Aimee (1976). Even more startling was her sterling role in Rede de Intrigas (1976), Paddy Chayefsky's blistering take on the television industry. Dunaway pulled out all the stops as an executive on the rise who stops at nothing to advance her career - even bedding veteran producer William Holden. Critics again rose in unison to praise Dunaway, and she finally netted an Oscar for the role, as well as a Golden Globe.Surprisingly, Dunaway's career began to fall away after her Oscar win. She was effective as a fashion photographer who experiences disturbing visions in Os Olhos de Laura Mars (1978), but was wasted in thankless roles as the dissatisfied ex of washed-up boxer Jon Voight in O Campe\u00e3o (1979) and wife to Frank Sinatra's detective in O Primeiro Pecado Mortal (1980). And then came Mam\u00e3ezinha Querida (1981), director Frank Perry's biopic of actress Joan Crawford based on the tell-all book by her daughter Christina. Crawford herself had praised Dunaway in the early stages of her career, and while some critics gave positive reviews to her performance - in particular, the extent to which she physically transformed herself into Crawford - most fixated on the hysterical dialogue and garish scenes of child abuse. Clips of Dunaway as Crawford bellowing \"No more wire hangers!\" became immediate laugh-getters on late-night television, and a substantial gay following rose up in response to the film's high camp value. Dunaway, however, found none of the response amusing, and later admitted her regret in taking the role. Whether laughable or pure genius, no one could deny that Dunaway threw her everything into the role. The film's continued cult success proved she had succeeded in becoming Crawford.The fallout from \"Mommie Dearest\" obscured Dunaway's follow-up projects, which included the title role in the 1981 TV-movie Evita Peron (1981) and a return to Broadway in 1982's \"The Curse of an Aching Heart.\" Discouraged, she moved to London with her second husband, photographer Terry O'Neill, who had also served as a producer on \"Mommie Dearest.\" For the next few years, Dunaway appeared sporadically in films, most of which underscored her newly minted status as a camp icon. A Perversa (1983) was an absurd, near-softcore period drama by Michael Winner, with Dunaway as an 18th-century highway robber. Fans of her early dramatic work were similarly aghast by her turn as a shrieking witch battling Helen Slater's Girl of Steel in Supergirl (1984). Only a Golden Globe-winning appearance in the cumbersome miniseries Ellis Island (1984) offered any respite from the negative press which now continued to follow her.Dunaway returned to the United States in 1987 following her divorce from O'Neill, and attempted to rebuild her career and reputation by appearing in several independent dramas. She was widely praised for her performance as a once-glamorous woman felled by alcohol in Barbet Schroeder's Barfly: Condenados pelo V\u00edcio (1987), and served as executive producer and star of Enigmas da Vida (1989), a TV adaptation of the popular novel by Olive Ann Burns about an independent-minded woman who romances a recently widowed store owner (Richard Widmark). Dunaway was exceptionally busy for the remainder of the decade in both major Hollywood features and independent fare, though her strong women now occasionally sported an unfortunate shrill side. She was Robert Duvall's frosty wife in the dystopian thriller A Decad\u00eancia de uma Esp\u00e9cie (1990) and contributed a vocal cameo as Evelyn Mulwray in A Chave do Enigma (1990), the ill-fated sequel to \"Chinatown.\" Other notable performances came as the unhappy wife of psychiatrist Marlon Brando in Don Juan DeMarco (1994), as the daughter of imprisoned Klansman Gene Hackman in O Segredo (1996) and as a bartender caught in the middle of a hostage standoff in Kevin Spacey's Ciladas da Sorte (1996). She later received Screen Actors Guild and Golden Globe nominations as the matron of a wealthy Jewish family in turmoil in Quest\u00e3o de Sensibilidade (1996). Perhaps her best turn of the decade was as a seductive murderess who attempts to sway the unflappable Lt. Columbo (Peter Falk) in Columbo: It's All in the Game (1993), which earned her a 1994 Emmy. In 1998, she won her third Golden Globe as modeling agency head Wilhelmina Cooper in the biopic Gia, Fama e Destrui\u00e7\u00e3o (1998), starring Angelina Jolie as doomed model Gia Carangi.The 1990s were also not without incident for Dunaway. She was embroiled in an ugly lawsuit against Andrew Lloyd Webber after he closed a Los Angeles production of his musical version of \"Sunset Blvd.\" with claims that she was unable to sing to his standards. The suit was later settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. A national tour of Terrence McNally's \"Master Class,\" about the legendary opera diva Maria Callas, ended with her involvement in a suit over legal rights to the play. The project was expected to become her next great film role, but remained uncompleted more than a decade after the 1996 tour. Her attempt at sitcom stardom in It Had to Be You (1993), co-starring Robert Urich, was met with universal disinterest, and the project was announced as being retooled without Dunaway prior to its cancellation.Dunaway's schedule remained busy from 2000 onward, mostly in television and small independent features. She co-starred with Mark Wahlberg and Joaquin Phoenix as the wife of career criminal James Caan in Caminho sem Volta (2000), then made her directorial debut with the short The Yellow Bird (2001), based on the play by Tennessee Williams. Younger audiences had their first taste of Dunaway's particular star power as Ian Somerhalder's mother in Regras da Atra\u00e7\u00e3o (2002), Roger Avary's amped-up adaptation of the Bret Easton Ellis novel, before Dunaway turned up the heat as a merciless celebrity judge on the reality series The Starlet (2005).Dunaway penned her memoirs, Looking For Gatsby, in 1995, one year before receiving her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Attached throughout her professional career to intriguing men ranging from Lenny Bruce to Marcello Mastroianni, she was twice married; her first husband was singer Peter Wolf of the popular seventies rock group, The J. Geils Band. Liam O'Neill, her son by second husband Terry, followed in her footsteps with minor acting roles beginning in 2004. His father later dropped a bombshell in 2003 by revealing that Liam was not their biological son, but was adopted - a claim that Dunaway had previously denied.A series of occasional roles in little-seen films followed, but Dunaway was unexpectedly thrust back into the public eye at the 2017 Academy Awards. Reunited with Warren Beatty on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" the pair were tapped to present the Best Picture award to close the night. Before proceeding onstage, Beatty was mistakenly handed a backup envelope for Best Actress in a Leading Role, which had already been won by Emma Stone for La La Land: Cantando Esta\u00e7\u00f5es (2016). Unsure what to do when he opened the envelope and discovered the error, Beatty stalled for time and showed the card to Dunaway; misunderstanding his intent, the actress announced that the Best Picture Oscar went to \"La La Land.\" During producer Jordan Horowitz's acceptance speech, he was informed that the actual Best Picture winner was Moonlight: Sob a Luz do Luar (2016). During the onstage chaos that ensued, Beatty delivered a heartfelt explanation and apology for the snafu while undergoing good-natured ribbing from host Jimmy Kimmel.After her break from acting and the memorable Oscars moment, Dunaway is now back in the saddle as an actress working more frequently in her 70s. Over the past year, she has appeared in three films, starring in Nunca Diga Seu Nome (2017), Em Defesa de Cristo (2017) and Inconceivable (2017), with more projects expected to be on the way. The icon also fronts Gucci's summer 2018 ad campaign for their Sylvie handbag and has a Broadway show scheduled for 2019.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Courenthea\n          \n\n", "realName": "Dorothy Faye Dunaway", "height": "170"},

His maternal grandfather was Sir Michael Balcon, an important figure in the history of British cinema and head of the famous Ealing Studios. His older sister, Tamasin Day-Lewis, is a documentarian. His father was of Northern Irish and English descent, and his mother was Jewish (from a family from Latvia and Poland). Daniel was educated at Sevenoaks School in Kent, which he despised, and the more progressive Bedales in Petersfield, which he adored. He studied acting at the Bristol Old Vic School. Daniel made his film debut in Domingo Maldito (1971), but then acted on stage with the Bristol Old Vic and Royal Shakespeare Companies and did not appear on screen again until 1982, when he landed his first adult role, a bit part in Gandhi (1982). He also appeared on British television that year in Frost in May (1982) and BBC2 Playhouse: How Many Miles to Babylon? (1982). Notable theatrical performances include Another Country (1982-83), Dracula (1984) and The Futurists (1986).His first major supporting role in a feature film was in Rebeli\u00e3o em Alto Mar (1984), quickly followed by Minha Ador\u00e1vel Lavanderia (1985) and Uma Janela para o Amor (1985). The latter two films opened in New York on the same day, offering audiences and critics evidence of his remarkable range and establishing him as a major talent. The New York Film Critics named him Best Supporting Actor for those performances. In 1986, he appeared on stage in Richard Eyre's \"The Futurists\" and on television in Eyre's production of Screen Two: The Insurance Man (1986). He also had a small role in a British/French film, Nanou (1986). In 1987, he assumed leading-man status in Philip Kaufman's A Insustent\u00e1vel Leveza do Ser (1988), followed by a comedic role in the unsuccessful Um Ingl\u00eas na Am\u00e9rica (1988). His brilliant performance as Christy Brown in Jim Sheridan's Meu P\u00e9 Esquerdo (1989) won him numerous awards, including the Academy Award for Best Actor.He returned to the stage to work again with Eyre, as Hamlet at the National Theater, but was forced to leave the production close to the end of its run because of exhaustion, and has not appeared on stage since. He took a hiatus from film as well until 1992, when he starred in O \u00daltimo dos Moicanos (1992), a film that met with mixed reviews but was a great success at the box office. He worked with American director Martin Scorsese in A \u00c9poca da Inoc\u00eancia (1993), based on Edith Wharton's novel. Subsequently, he teamed again with Jim Sheridan to star in Em Nome do Pai (1993), a critically acclaimed performance that earned him another Academy Award nomination. His next project was in the role of John Proctor in father-in-law Arthur Miller's play As Bruxas de Sal\u00e9m (1996), directed by Nicholas Hytner. He worked with Scorsese again to star in Gangues de Nova York (2002), another critically acclaimed performance that earned him another Academy Award nomination for Best Actor.Day-Lewis's wife, Rebecca Miller, offered him the lead role in her film O Mundo de Jack e Rose (2005), in which he played a dying man with regrets over how his wife had evolved and over how he had brought up his teenage daughter. During filming, he arranged to live separate from his wife to achieve the \"isolation\" needed to focus on his own character's reality. The film received mixed reviews. In 2007, he starred in director Paul Thomas Anderson's loose adaptation of Upton Sinclair's novel \"Oil!\", titled Sangue Negro (2007). Day-Lewis received the Academy Award for Best Actor, BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Drama, Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role, and a variety of film critics' circle awards for the role. In 2009, Day-Lewis starred in Rob Marshall's musical adaptation Nine (2009) as film director Guido Contini.

At an early age he was already appearing in community plays and by his early teens he got his first TV appearance on an episode of Smart Guy (1998). His first major role was as Howie Blitzer, a trouble teenager who gets involved with an older man, played by Brian Cox, in the controversial and acclaimed Sem Sa\u00edda (2001). For the role, Dano was awarded an Independent Spirit Award in the Best Debut Performance category, along with some other awards from Indie cinema. From the on, he moved on to supporting roles in Thank You, Jeeves! (1936), Show de Vizinha (2004), Roubando Vidas (2004), The King (2005), Na\u00e7\u00e3o Fast Food: Uma Rede de Corrup\u00e7\u00e3o (2006) and O Mundo de Jack e Rose (2005).Dano's rise to stardom came in consecutive films that showcased his talents and made him an important name in the business: as Dwayne, a rebel teen who copes with his teen angst by refusing to speak to everyone in his family, only using of his cold expressions and a notepad in Pequena Miss Sunshine (2006), he was praised by critics and audiences, a role that earned him among other awards the Screen Actors Guild as Best Ensemble Cast. The following year, he appeared on a dual role as twin brothers Paul and Eli Sunday - the latter character, a devoted preacher, is more extensive and challenging than the mysterious Paul, in Paul Thomas Anderson critically acclaimed Sangue Negro (2007). The role was given to Dano after a recommendation from Daniel Day-Lewis who had worked with the young actor in O Mundo de Jack e Rose (2005) and found him a very talented and interesting role. Anderson followed Day-Lewis suggestion, and the result was another hit for Dano, who received several awards nominations, including for the Bafta as Best Supporting Actor.After that, he went on with his career with Aconteceu em Woodstock (2009), Cowboys & Aliens (2011), Ruby Sparks - A Namorada Perfeita (2012) - in which he appears alongside his girlfriend Zoe Kazan, Looper: Assassinos do Futuro (2012), as the tortured suspect in Os Suspeitos (2013); the Oscar winning 12 Anos de Escravid\u00e3o (2013); as a young Method actor in Juventude (2015); the freak comedy Um Cad\u00e1ver Para Sobreviver (2016); Okja (2017); and the miniseries Guerra & Paz (2016) and Escape at Dannemora (2018), the latter being a role completely the opposite he ever played in previous years, as an inmate who escapes jail, a very physical work for him. In between those films and projects, he gained notoriety by playing the young Brian Wilson in The Beach Boys: Uma Hist\u00f3ria de Sucesso (2014), the Beach Boys leader who suffers a nervous breakdown while trying to compose an epic album. That role gave Paul Dano plenty of buzz during awards season, some deserved recognition and his first Golden Globe nomination in the Best Supporting Actor category.His career seems to always be going further each year goes by, always promising.

Playing such classic characters as \"Mr. Rochester\" in Jane Eyre (1997), and \"Captain Wentworth\" in Screen Two: Persuas\u00e3o (1995) has increased his popularity and most definitely given him much increased recognition. As for his personal life, you won't be likely to see his name in the weekly tabloids. He likes to keep his private life private. It is known that he is in a long-term, committed relationship with a French-Vietnamese actress named H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Patarot and they have a daughter together and live in Paris. He is in very high demand and his reputation as a quality, professional actor is sure to keep him busy for as long as he chooses.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Sheryl Reeder <sherry@reeder.com>\n          \n\n", "realName": null, "height": "183"},

He was one of the first of the \"video store\" generation of film-makers. His father was the first man on his block to own a V.C.R., and from a very early age Anderson had an infinite number of titles available to him. While film-makers like Spielberg cut their teeth making 8 mm films, Anderson cut his teeth shooting films on video and editing them from V.C.R. to V.C.R.Part of Anderson's artistic D.N.A. comes from his father, who hosted a late night horror show in Cleveland. His father knew a number of oddball celebrities such as Robert Ridgely, an actor who often appeared in Mel Brooks' films and would later play \"The Colonel\" in Anderson's Boogie Nights: Prazer Sem Limites (1997). Anderson was also very much shaped by growing up in \"The Valley\", specifically the suburban San Fernando Valley of greater Los Angeles. The Valley may have been immortalized in the 1980s for its mall-hopping \"Valley Girls\", but for Anderson it was a slightly seedy part of suburban America. You were close to Hollywood, yet you weren't there. Would-bes and burn-outs populated the area. Anderson's experiences growing up in \"The Valley\" have no doubt shaped his artistic self, especially since three of his four theatrical features are set in the Valley.Anderson got into film-making at a young age. His most significant amateur film was The Dirk Diggler Story (1988), a sort of mock-documentary a la Isto \u00e9 Spinal Tap (1984), about a once-great pornography star named Dirk Diggler. After enrolling in N.Y.U.'s film program for two days, Anderson got his tuition back and made his own short film, Cigarettes & Coffee (1993). He also worked as a production assistant on numerous commercials and music videos before he got the chance to make his first feature, something he liked to call Jogada de Risco (1996), but would later become known to the public as \"Hard Eight\". The film was developed and financed through The Sundance Lab, not unlike Quentin Tarantino's C\u00e3es de Aluguel (1992). Anderson cast three actors whom he would continue working with in the future: Altman veteran Philip Baker Hall, the husky and lovable John C. Reilly and, in a small part, Philip Seymour Hoffman, who so far has been featured in all four of Anderson's films. The film deals with a guardian angel type (played by Hall) who takes down-on-his-luck Reilly under his wing. The deliberately paced film featured a number of Anderson trademarks: wonderful use of source light, long takes and top-notch acting. Yet the film was reedited (and retitled) by Rysher Entertainment against Anderson's wishes. It was admired by critics, but didn't catch on at the box office. Still, it was enough for Anderson to eventually get his next movie financed. \"Boogie Nights\" was, in a sense, a remake of \"The Dirk Diggler Story\", but Anderson threw away the satirical approach and instead painted a broad canvas about a makeshift family of pornographers. The film was often joyous in its look at the 1970s and the days when pornography was still shot on film, still shown in theatres, and its actors could at least delude themselves into believing that they were movie stars. Yet \"Boogie Nights\" did not flinch at the dark side, showing a murder and suicide, literally in one (almost) uninterrupted shot, and also showing the lives of these people deteriorate, while also showing how their lives recovered.Anderson not only worked with Hall, Reilly and Hoffman again, he also worked with Julianne Moore, Melora Walters, William H. Macy and Luis Guzm\u00e1n. Collectively, Anderson had something that was rare in U.S. cinema: a stock company of top-notch actors. Aside from the above mentioned, Anderson also drew terrific performances from Burt Reynolds and Mark Wahlberg, two actors whose careers were not exactly going full-blast at the time of \"Boogie Nights\", but who found themselves to be that much more employable afterwards.The success of \"Boogie Nights\" gave Anderson the chance to really go for broke in Magn\u00f3lia (1999), a massive mosaic that could dwarf Altman's Nashville (1975) in its number of characters.Anderson was awarded a \"Best Director\" award at Cannes for Embriagado de Amor (2002).\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Nathan Cox and Brian McInnis\n          \n\n", "realName": null, "height": "179"},

He spent his youth in the pursuit of sports. He became an expert rider early on, working at his uncle's horse-breeding estate while studying at the King's College in Cardiff. At 21, he went to London as a member of the elite Household Cavalry (Guard for the Royal Family), undergoing a rigorous 19-months training, further honing his equestrian skills, as well as becoming adept at fencing, boxing and shooting. He won trophies, including the Bisley Match, with his unit's crack rifle team. However, after four years, he suddenly lost his means of financial support (independent income being a requirement as a Guardsman) when his stepfather discontinued his allowance. Broke, he tried his hand at acting in small parts on the London stage.There are several stories as to how he derived his stage name. It is known, that during his teens he called himself \"Mullane\", using his stepfather's surname. He may later have suffused \"Mullane\" with \"mill-lands\", an area near his hometown. When he first appeared on screen in British films, he was billed first as Spike Milland, then Raymond Milland.In 1929, Ray befriended the popular actress Estelle Brody at a party and, later that year, visited her on the set of her latest film, The Plaything (1929). While having lunch, they were joined by a producer who persuaded the handsome Welshman to appear in a motion picture bit part. Ray rose to the challenge and bigger roles followed, including the male lead in The Lady from the Sea (1929). The following year, he was signed by MGM and went to Hollywood, but was given little to work with, except for the role of Charles Laughton's ill-fated nephew in Castigo do C\u00e9u (1932). After a year, Ray was out of his contract and returned to England.His big break did not come until 1934 when he joined Paramount, where he was to remain for the better part of his Hollywood career. During the first few years, he served an apprenticeship playing second leads, usually as the debonair man-about-town, in light romantic comedies. He appeared with Burns and Allen in Muitas Felicidades (1934), enjoyed third-billing as a British aristocrat in the Claudette Colbert farce O L\u00edrio Dourado (1935) and was described as \"excellent\" by reviewers for his role in the sentimental drama Mulher Admir\u00e1vel (1935). By 1936, he had graduated to starring roles, first as the injured British hunter rescued on a tropical island by Princesa da Selva (1936), the film which launched Dorothy Lamour's sarong-clad career. After that, he was the titular hero of Evas\u00e3o de Bulldog Drummond (1937) and, finally, won the girl (rather than being the \"other man\") in Mitchell Leisen's screwball comedy Garota de Sorte (1937). He also re-visited the tropics in O Tuf\u00e3o (1937), Id\u00edlio na Selva (1938) and Feiti\u00e7o do Tr\u00f3pico (1938), as well as being one of the three valiant brothers of Beau Geste (1939).In 1940, Ray was sent back to England to star in the screen adaptation of Terence Rattigan's Ca\u00e7adora de Cora\u00e7\u00f5es (1940), for which he received his best critical reviews to date. He was top-billed (above John Wayne) running a ship salvage operation in Cecil B. DeMille's lavish Technicolor adventure drama Vendaval de Paix\u00f5es (1942), besting Wayne in a fight - much to the \"Duke's\" personal chagrin - and later wrestling with a giant octopus. Also that year, he was directed by Billy Wilder in a charming comedy, A Incr\u00edvel Suzana (1942) (co-starred with Ginger Rogers), for which he garnered good notices from Bosley Crowther of the New York Times. Ray then played a ghost hunter in O Solar das Almas Perdidas (1944), and the suave hero caught in a web of espionage in Fritz Lang's thriller Quando Desceram as Trevas (1944).On the strength of his previous role as \"Major Kirby\", Billy Wilder chose to cast Ray against type in the ground-breaking drama Farrapo Humano (1945) as dipsomaniac writer \"Don Birnam\". Ray gave the defining performance of his career, his intensity catching critics, used to him as a lightweight leading man, by surprise. Crowther commented \"Mr. Milland, in a splendid performance, catches all the ugly nature of a 'drunk', yet reveals the inner torment and degradation of a respectable man who knows his weakness and his shame\" (New York Times, December 3, 1945). Arrived at the high point of his career, Ray Milland won the Oscar for Best Actor, as well as the New York Critic's Award. Rarely given such good material again, he nonetheless featured memorably in many more splendid films, often exploiting the newly discovered \"darker side\" of his personality: as the reporter framed for murder by Charles Laughton's heinous publishing magnate in O Rel\u00f3gio Verde (1948); as the sophisticated, manipulating art thief \"Mark Bellis\" in the Victorian melodrama Alma Negra (1948) (for which producer Hal B. Wallis sent him back to England); as a Fedora-wearing, Armani-suited \"Lucifer\", trawling for the soul of an honest District Attorney in O Enviado de Satan\u00e1s (1949); and as a traitorous scientist in O Ladr\u00e3o Silencioso (1952), giving what critics described as a \"sensitive\" and \"towering\" performance. In 1954, Ray played calculating ex-tennis champ \"Tony Wendice\", who blackmails a former Cambridge chump into murdering his wife, in Alfred Hitchcock's Disque M para Matar (1954). He played the part with urbane sophistication and cold detachment throughout, even in the scene of denouement, calmly offering a drink to the arresting officers.With Lisboa (1956), Ray Milland moved into another direction, turning out several off-beat, low-budget films with himself as the lead, notably O Arrombador de Cofres (1958) and P\u00e2nico no Ano Zero (1962). At the same time, he cheerfully made the transition to character parts, often in horror and sci-fi outings. In accordance with his own dictum of appearing in anything that had \"any originality\", he worked on two notable pictures with Roger Corman: first, as a man obsessed with catalepsy in Obsess\u00e3o Macabra (1962); secondly, as obsessed self-destructive surgeon \"Dr. Xavier\" in O Homem dos Olhos de Raio-X (1963)-the Man with X-Ray Eyes, a film which, despite its low budget, won the 1963 Golden Asteroid in the Trieste Festival for Science Fiction.As the years went on, Ray gradually disposed of his long-standing toupee, lending dignity through his presence to many run-of-the-mill television films, such as Cave In! (1983) and maudlin melodramas like Love Story: Uma Hist\u00f3ria de Amor (1970). He guest-starred in many anthology series on television and had notable roles in Rod Serling's Galeria do Terror (1969) and the original Galactica: Astronave de Combate (1978) (as Quorum member Sire Uri). He also enjoyed a brief run on Broadway, starring as \"Simon Crawford\" in \"Hostile Witness\" (1966), at the Music Box Theatre.In his private life, Ray was an enthusiastic yachtsman, who loved fishing and collecting information by reading the Encyclopedia Brittanica. In later years, he became very popular with interviewers because of his candid spontaneity and humour. In the same self-deprecating vein he wrote an anecdotal biography, \"Wide-Eyed in Babylon\", in 1976. A film star, as well as an outstanding actor, Ray Milland died of cancer at the age of 79 in March 1986.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            I.S.Mowis\n          \n\n", "realName": "Reginald Alfred John Truscott-Jones", "height": "186"},

He was educated at Carnegie Tech and the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. Deciding that Broadway producers would be more interested in an upper-crust Englishman than a kid from Joplin, Missouri, Cummings passed himself off as Blade Stanhope Conway, British actor. The ploy was successful. Cummings decided that if it worked on Broadway, it would work in Hollywood, so he journeyed west and assumed the identity of a rich Texan named Bruce Hutchens. The plan worked once more, and he began securing small parts in films. He soon reverted to his real name and became a popular leading man in light comedies, usually playing well-meaning, pleasant but somewhat bumbling young men. He achieved much more success, however, in his own television series in the '50s, The Bob Cummings Show (1955) and My Living Doll (1964).\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            frankfob2@yahoo.com\n          \n\n", "realName": "Charles Clarence Robert Orville Cummings", "height": "178"},

Playing Hubbard on the Great White Way brought him the 1953 Tony Award as Best Featured Actor in a Play. \"Dial M for Murder\" was the 27th Broadway play he had appeared in since making his New York debut in \"The Fake\" in 1924, which he had originally appeared in back in his native England.Williams was born on April 15, 1903 in Buckinghamshire and attended Lancing College. He first trod the boards as a teenager in a 1916 production of Peter Pan (1924). He moved to America in the mid-1920s and was a busy and constantly employed stage actor for 30 years. After \"Dial M for Murder\" in the 1953-54 season, though, he appeared in only four more Broadway plays between 1955 and 1970 as he focused on movies and television.In addition to \"Dial M for Murder\", he appeared in Hitchcock's Agonia de Amor (1947) and in Ladr\u00e3o de Casaca (1955) and in 10 episodes of the TV series Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1955). For Billy Wilder, he appeared in Sabrina (1954) and Testemunha de Acusa\u00e7\u00e3o (1957). Beginning in the 1960s, most of his work was in television, including a nine-episode stint on Family Affair (1966) taking over Sebastian Cabot's duties as Brian Keith's butler when Cabot was waylaid by health problems.He retired in the late '70s, his last acting gig being an appearance on Galactica: Astronave de Combate (1978) in 1979.

The film and T.V. series, As Melhores Inten\u00e7\u00f5es (1992) is biographical and shows the early marriage of his parents. The film 'S\u00f6ndagsbarn' depicts a bicycle journey with his father. In the miniseries Enskilda samtal (1996) is the trilogy closed. Here, as in 'Den Goda Viljan' Pernilla August play his mother. Note that all three movies are not always full true biographical stories. He began his career early with a puppet theatre which he, his sister and their friends played with. But he was the manager. Strictly professional he begun writing in 1941. He had written a play called 'Kaspers d\u00f6d' (A.K.A. 'Kaspers Death') which was produced the same year. It became his entrance into the movie business as Stina Bergman (not a close relative), from the company S.F. (Swedish Filmindustry), had seen the play and thought that there must be some dramatic talent in young Ingmar. His first job was to save other more famous writers' poor scripts. Under one of that script-saving works he remembered that he had written a novel about his last year as a student. He took the novel, did the save-poor-script job first, then wrote a screenplay on his own novel. When he went back to S.F., he delivered two scripts rather than one. The script was Tortura do Desejo (1944) and was the fist Bergman screenplay that was put into film (by Alf Sj\u00f6berg). It was also in that movie Bergman did his first professional film-director job. Because Alf Sj\u00f6berg was busy, Bergman got the order to shoot the last sequence of the film. Ingmar Bergman is the father of Daniel Bergman, director, and Mats Bergman, actor at the Swedish Royal Dramatic Theater. Ingmar Bergman was also C.E.O. of the same theatre between 1963-1966, where he hired almost every professional actor in Sweden. In 1976 he had a famous tax problem. Bergman had trusted other people to advise him on his finances, but it turned out to be very bad advice. Bergman had to leave the country immediately, and so he went to Germany. A few years later he returned to Sweden and made his last theatrical film Fanny e Alexander (1982) (A.K.A. 'Fanny and Alexander'). In later life he retired from movie directing, but still wrote scripts for film and T.V. and directed plays at the Swedish Royal Dramatic Theatre for many years. He died peacefully in his sleep on July 30, 2007.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Anders ADe Dahnielson <adeswed@algonet.se>\n          \n\n", "realName": "Ernst Ingmar Bergman", "height": "179"},

Josh was not interested at first in the lifestyle of the entertainment business, in light of his parents' divorce, and both of them being actors. However, during junior year in high school, he took an acting class to see what it was like. He played Stanley in \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" and became hooked. His first major screen role was as the older brother in the film Os Goonies (1985), based on a story by Steven Spielberg. He then immediately moved on to work on television, taking roles on such series as Detetive Particular: Pilot (1987) and The Young Riders (1989). \"Private Eye\" was a chance for Brolin to play a detective. \"The Young Riders\" was set just before the Civil War, and was co-directed by Brolin's father, James Brolin.After The Young Riders (1989), Brolin moved back to the big screen, with mediocre success. He played a supporting role in Assassinos da Estrada (1994), but the film was not a success. He followed up with the crime film Gang in Blue (1996), the romantic film Rosas da Sedu\u00e7\u00e3o (1996), the thriller film O Principal Suspeito (1997), and appeared with his father in My Brother's War (1997). However, nothing truly stuck out, especially not the box office flop Mod Squad: O Filme (1999). The 2000s initially brought no significant change in Brolin's career. He appeared in the independent film Slow Burn (2000), the sci-if thriller O Homem sem Sombra (2000) and starred on the television series Mister Sterling (2003). In 2004, he married actress Diane Lane and are still together.It was not until 2007 that Brolin received much acclaim for his films. He took a supporting role in the Quentin Tarantino-written Grindhouse (2007) which was a two-part film accounting two horror stories. He also played two policemen that year: corrupt officer Nick Trupo in the crime epic O G\u00e2ngster (2007), and an honest police chief in the emotional drama No Vale das Sombras (2007) which starred Tommy Lee Jones and was directed by Paul Haggis. However, it was his involvement in Onde os Fracos N\u00e3o T\u00eam Vez (2007) that truly pushed him into the limelight. The film, directed by the Coen brothers, was about a man (Brolin) who finds a satchel containing two million dollars in cash. He is pursued by an unstoppable assassin (Javier Bardem, who won an Oscar for his work) and his friend, a local sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones). The film won four Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director.Brolin found high-profile work the next year, being cast as Supervisor Dan White in the film Milk: A Voz da Igualdade (2008). His performance as the weak and bitter politician earned him an Oscar nomination, and Brolin received more praise for his fascinating portrayal of George W. Bush in the Oliver Stone film W. (2008). Despite the mediocre success of W. (2008), he was recognized as the best part of the film, and Milk: A Voz da Igualdade (2008) was another triumph, critically and commercially.Brolin then acted in the smaller comedy Doces Problemas (2009) before landing a number of large roles in 2010. The first of these was the film based on the comic book figure Jonah Hex - Ca\u00e7ador de Recompensas (2010). The film was a box office flop and critically panned, but Brolin also forged a second collaboration with legendary director Oliver Stone for Wall Street: O Dinheiro Nunca Dorme (2010). Brolin played a large role alongside such young stars as Carey Mulligan and Shia LaBeouf, and older thespians such as Michael Douglas, Eli Wallach, and Frank Langella. Brolin's character was Bretton James, a top banker in the film, and also the film's chief antagonist. Brolin also appeared in Woody Allen's London-based film Voc\u00ea Vai Conhecer o Homem dos Seus Sonhos (2010) and a second collaboration with the Coen Brothers, which was a remake of Bravura Ind\u00f4mita (1969).Despite his earlier mediocre success and fame, Brolin has maintained a choosiness in his films and, recently, these choices have paid off profoundly. Hopefully, he continues this streak of good fortune that his talents have finally given him.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Bob Stage\n          \n\n", "realName": "Josh J.

His parents encouraged him to leave school and pursue his acting goals rather than be unhappy. McGregor studied drama for a year at Kirkcaldly in Fife, then enrolled at London's Guildhall School of Music and Drama for a three-year course. He studied alongside Daniel Craig and Alistair McGowan, among others, and left right before graduating after snagging the role of Private Mick Hopper in Dennis Potter's six-part Channel 4 series Batom no Colarinho (1993).

McGregor is married to French production designer Eve Mavrakis, whom he met while working on the television series Kavanagh QC (1995). They married in France in the summer of 1995, and have four daughters. McGregor formed a production company, with friends Jonny Lee Miller, Sean Pertwee, Jude Law, Sadie Frost, Damon Bryant, Bradley Adams and Geoff Deehan, called \"Natural Nylon\", and hoped it would make innovative films that do not conform to Hollywood standards.

Ewen has established himself by creating unique characters in critically acclaimed films, as well as going toe to toe with many of Hollywood's biggest stars.Bremner had worked widely in theatre, television, and film for years before being cast in his breakout role in Trainspotting: Sem Limites (1996), by Oscar-winning director Danny Boyle. Having originated the role of Mark Renton in Edinburgh's Traverse Theatre production, Bremner then made waves opposite Ewan McGregor playing Spud Murphy and earned screen immortality with his character's infamous \"speed fueled\" job interview scene.Prior to Trainspotting, Bremner gave a striking performance in Mike Leigh's Naked, starring opposite David Thewlis. In 1999, Bremner received critical acclaim for his portrayal of a schizophrenic man living with his dysfunctional family in Harmony Korine's Julien Donkey-Boy. Filmed strictly in accordance with the ultra-realist tenants of Lars Von Trier's Dogma 95 movement and starring opposite Werner Herzog, Bremner played Julien its eponymous hero, requiring him to assume an American accent. He then worked with director Michael Bay in his high-profile 2001 war film Pearl Harbor (2001), proving his versatility once again by portraying the role of a wholeheartedly patriotic American soldier fighting in WWII. The following year, he stepped back into fatigues for a supporting role in Ridley Scott's Falc\u00e3o Negro em Perigo (2001), while rounding out the next several years with roles in high-profile Hollywood releases such as Bem-Vindo \u00e0 Selva (2003), Disney's Volta ao Mundo em 80 Dias: Uma Aposta Muito Louca (2004), Alien vs. Predador (2004) Woody Allen's Ponto Final: Match Point (2005), the comedy Morte no Funeral (2007) directed by Frank Oz, and Fool's Gold (2005) starring Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson.This past year proved to be a busy one when Bremner was invited to join the DC Universe in the Zack Snyder-produced feature Wonder Woman, directed by Patty Jenkins, co-starring Gal Gadot and Chris Pine, and set for release by Warner Bros. in the summer of 2017. Ewen would also reprise his unforgettable role as \"Spud\" in the highly-anticipated sequel to Danny Boyle's cult classic, T2: Trainspotting, for Sony due out early 2017.

She made her cinema debut in Almas Desesperadas (1952) in 1952 and over the next five years appeared in a lot of undistinguished movies as a supporting actress, such as A Besta Negra (1954), O C\u00f3digo do Diabo (1955) and A Garota das Meias Pretas (1957). By 1957 she had grown dissatisfied with the roles she was getting, left the film industry and spent the next five years doing plays on Broadway. She returned to the screen in 1962 with her portrayal of Annie Sullivan in O Milagre de Anne Sullivan (1962), for which she won an Oscar. Bancroft went on to give acclaimed performances in Crescei e Multiplicai-vos (1964), Uma Vida em Suspense (1965), As Garras do Le\u00e3o (1972), O Prisioneiro da Segunda Avenida (1975), O Homem Elefante (1980), Sou ou N\u00e3o Sou (1983), Nunca te Vi, Sempre te Amei (1987) and other movies as lead actress, but her most famous role would be as Mrs. Robinson in A Primeira Noite de um Homem (1967). Her status as the predatory \"older woman\" in the film is iconic, although in real life she was just 36 and only six years older than co-star Dustin Hoffman. Bancroft would later express her frustration over the fact that the film overshadowed her other work. Selective for much of her intermittent career, she appeared on the screen more frequently in the '90s, playing a range of characters in such films as Po\u00e7\u00e3o do Amor N\u00ba 9 (1992), A Assassina (1993), Feriados em Fam\u00edlia (1995), At\u00e9 o Limite da Honra (1997), Grandes Esperan\u00e7as (1998) and Uma Paix\u00e3o em Floren\u00e7a (2000). She also started to make some TV films, including Deep in My Heart (1999) for which she won an Emmy. Sadly, on June 6, 2005, Bancroft passed away at the age of 73 from uterine cancer. Her death surprised many, as she had not revealed any information of her illness to the public. Among her survivors was her husband of 41 years, Mel Brooks, and her only child, Max Brooks, who was born in 1972.

He attended various art schools, married Peggy Lynch and then fathered future director Jennifer Lynch shortly after he turned 21. That experience, plus attending art school in a particularly violent and run-down area of Philadelphia, inspired Eraserhead (1977), a film that he began in the early 1970s (after a couple of shorts) and which he would work on obsessively for five years. The final film was initially judged to be almost unreleasable weird, but thanks to the efforts of distributor Ben Barenholtz, it secured a cult following and enabled Lynch to make his first mainstream film (in an unlikely alliance with Mel Brooks), though O Homem Elefante (1980) was shot through with his unique sensibility. Its enormous critical and commercial success led to Duna (1984), a hugely expensive commercial disaster, but Lynch redeemed himself with the now classic Veludo Azul (1986), his most personal and original work since his debut. He subsequently won the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival with the dark, violent road movie Cora\u00e7\u00e3o Selvagem (1990), and achieved a huge cult following with his surreal TV series Twin Peaks (1990), which he adapted for the big screen, though his comedy series On the Air (1992) was less successful.

She is the first of three children of Judith (Cook), a customer service representative, and Bob Collett, a truck driver. From age six, she was brought up in suburban Sydney. At the age of eleven, she showed her phenomenal acting skills when she faked appendicitis out of boredom and longing for attention; her act was so convincing that doctors had to remove her appendix, even though the test showed nothing was wrong with it. At 16, she left school and enrolled in the National Institute of Dramatic Arts (NIDA). At that time, she was a struggling actress, supporting herself by delivering pizzas. After 18 months of studies, she left NIDA for her feature film debut as \"Wendy Robinson\", opposite Russell Crowe and Anthony Hopkins, in Spotswood (1992), and earned herself a nomination for Best Supporting Actress from the Australian Film Institute. Collette made her stage debut with the Sydney Theatre Company, as \"Sonya\" in Anton Chekhov's \"Uncle Vanya\", a performance that won her a critic's circle award as Best Newcomer. She also appeared in stage productions at the Belvoir Street Theatre, under directorship of Geoffrey Rush. In 1994, she won the Australian Best Actress in a Lead Role for her work in O Casamento de Muriel (1994), for which she had to gain 40 pounds in seven weeks. In 1995, Toni Collette came to Hollywood with a supporting role in O Primeiro Amor de um Homem (1996), then had a string of supporting roles. Her first lead as \"Diana Spencer\", an Australian woman who shares the name and birthday of Princess Diana, in the comedy, Diana & Me (1997), was obscured by the real Diana's death, which practically occurred at the same time when the movie was released. Her breakthrough came with the role as \"Lynn Sear\" in O Sexto Sentido (1999), for which she quite rightly won an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. Her latest memorable role as \"Sheryl\", a beaten-down but loving mother, in Pequena Miss Sunshine (2006), is also a fine ensemble work with Abigail Breslin, Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell, Paul Dano, and Alan Arkin. Since 2003, Toni Collette has been married to musician Dave Galafassi, with whom she recorded her singing and songwriting debut album, titled \"Beautiful Awkward Pictures\", in 2006. She co-owns an independent production company in Australia, and also continues her music career as a singer. Toni resides with her husband in Sydney, Australia, and owns a second home in Ireland.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Steve Shelokhonov\n          \n\n", "realName": "Antonia Collette", "height": "173"},

He was of German, Irish, and Swiss-German descent. When he was seven months old, his mother died, and his father sent him to live with his maternal aunt and uncle in Pennsylvania, where he stayed until he was two. His father then returned to take him back to Cadiz. At 16, he quit high school, went to work in an Akron, Ohio, tire factory, and decided to become an actor after seeing the play \"The Bird of Paradise\". He toured in stock companies, worked oil fields and sold ties. On December 13, 1924, he married Josephine Dillon, his acting coach and 15 years his senior. Around that time, they moved to Hollywood, so that Clark could concentrate on his acting career. In April 1930, they divorced and a year later, he married Maria Langham (a.k.a. Maria Franklin Gable), also about 17 years older than him.While Gable acted on stage, he became a lifelong friend of Lionel Barrymore. After several failed screen tests (for Barrymore and Darryl F. Zanuck), Gable was signed in 1930 by MGM's Irving Thalberg. He had a small part in O Deserto Pintado (1931) with starred William Boyd. Joan Crawford asked for him as co-star in Quando o Mundo Dan\u00e7a (1931) and the public loved him manhandling Norma Shearer in Uma Alma Livre (1931) the same year. His unshaven lovemaking with bra-less Jean Harlow in Terra de Paix\u00f5es (1932) made him MGM's most important star.His acting career then flourished. At one point, he refused an assignment, and the studio punished him by loaning him out to (at the time) low-rent Columbia Pictures, which put him in Frank Capra's Aconteceu Naquela Noite (1934), which won him an Academy Award for his performance. The next year saw a starring role in O Grito da Selva (1935) with Loretta Young, with whom he had an affair (resulting in the birth of a daughter, Judy Lewis). He returned to far more substantial roles at MGM, such as Fletcher Christian in O Grande Motim (1935) and Rhett Butler in ...E o Vento Levou (1939).After divorcing Maria Langham, in March 1939 Clark married Carole Lombard, but tragedy struck in January 1942 when the plane in which Carole and her mother were flying crashed into Table Rock Mountain, Nevada, killing them both. A grief-stricken Gable joined the US Army Air Force and was off the screen for three years, flying combat missions in Europe. When he returned the studio regarded his salary as excessive and did not renew his contract. He freelanced, but his films didn't do well at the box office. He married Sylvia Ashley, the widow of Douglas Fairbanks, in 1949. Unfortunately this marriage was short-lived and they divorced in 1952. In July 1955 he married a former sweetheart, Kathleen Williams Spreckles (a.k.a. Kay Williams) and became stepfather to her two children, Joan and Adolph (\"Bunker\") Spreckels III.On November 16, 1959, Gable became a grandfather when Judy Lewis, his daughter with Loretta Young, gave birth to a daughter, Maria. In 1960, Gable's wife Kay discovered that she was expecting their first child. In early November 1960, he had just completed filming Os Desajustados (1961), when he suffered a heart attack, and died later that month, on November 16, 1960. Gable was buried shortly afterwards in the shrine that he had built for Carole Lombard and her mother when they died, at Forest Lawn Cemetery.In March 1961, Kay Gable gave birth to a boy, whom she named John Clark Gable after his father.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Ed Stephan <stephan@cc.wwu.edu> and Gable Freak\n          \n\n", "realName": "William Clark Gable", "height": "184"},

In the mountains above Calcutta, a little princess is born. Because of the outbreak of World War I, she is six years old the first time her parents take her to England. Her mother thinks she should have a proper English upbringing and insists on leaving her in a convent school - even though Vivien is two years younger than any of the other girls at the school. The only comfort for the lonely child is a cat that was in the courtyard of the school that the nuns let her take up to her dormitory. Her first and best friend at the school is an eight-year-old girl, Maureen O'Sullivan who has been transplanted from Ireland. In the bleakness of a convent school, the two girls can recreate in their imaginations the places they have left and places where they would some day like to travel. After Vivien has been at the school for 18 months, her mother comes again from India and takes her to a play in London. In the next six months Vivien will insist on seeing the same play 16 times. In India the British community entertained themselves at amateur theatricals and Vivien's father was a leading man. Pupils at the English convent school are eager to perform in school plays. It's an all-girls school, so some of the girls have to play the male roles. The male roles are so much more adventurous. Vivien's favorite actor is Leslie Howard, and at 19 she marries an English barrister who looks very much like him. The year is 1932. Vivien's best friend from that convent school has gone to California, where she's making movies. Vivien has an opportunity to play a small role in an English film, Things Are Looking Up (1935). She has only one line but the camera keeps returning to her face. The London stage is more exciting than the movies being filmed in England, and the most thrilling actor on that stage is Laurence Olivier. At a party Vivien finds out about a stage role, \"The Green Sash\", where the only requirement is that the leading lady be beautiful. The play has a very brief run, but now she is a real actress. An English film is going to be made about Elizabeth I. Laurence gets the role of a young favorite of the queen who is sent to Spain. Vivien gets a much smaller role as a lady-in-waiting of the queen who is in love with Laurence's character. In real life, both fall in love while making this film, Fogo Por Sobre a Inglaterra (1937). In 1938, Hollywood wants Laurence to play Heathcliff in O Morro dos Ventos Uivantes (1939). Vivien, who has just recently read ...E o Vento Levou (1939), thinks that the role of Scarlett O'Hara is the first role for an actress that would be really exciting to bring to the screen. She sails to America for a brief vacation. In New York she gets on a plane for the first time to rush to California to see Laurence. They have dinner with Myron Selznick the night that his brother, David O. Selznick, is burning Atlanta on a backlot of MGM (actually they are burning old sets that go back to the early days of silent films to make room to recreate an Atlanta of the 1860s). Vivien is 26 when ...E o Vento Levou (1939) makes a sweep of the Oscars in 1939. So let's show 26-year-old Vivien walking up to the stage to accept her Oscar and then as the Oscar is presented the camera focuses on Vivien's face and through the magic of digitally altering images, the 26-year-old face merges into the face of Vivien at age 38 getting her second Best Actress Oscar for portraying Blanche DuBois in Uma Rua Chamada Pecado (1951). She wouldn't have returned to America to make that film had not Laurence been going over there to do a film, Perdi\u00e7\u00e3o por Amor (1952) based on Theodore Dreiser's novel \"Sister Carrie\". Laurence tells their friends that his motive for going to Hollywood to make films is to get enough money to produce his own plays for the London stage. He even has his own theater there, the St. James. Now Sir Laurence, with a seat in the British House of Lords, is accompanied by Vivien the day the Lords are debating about whether the St James should be torn down. Breaking protocol, Vivien speaks up and is escorted from the House of Lords. The publicity helps raise the funds to save the St. James. Throughout their two-decade marriage Laurence and Vivien were acting together on the stage in London and New York. Vivien was no longer Lady Olivier when she performed her last major film role, Em Roma na Primavera (1961).\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Dale O'Connor < daleoc@worldnet.att.net>\n          \n\n", "realName": "Vivian Mary Hartley", "height": "161"},

He became interested in working on the other side of the camera, and eventually got a job as a cameraman on many of the films of Douglas Fairbanks. He soon began directing, and his first big hit was Agora ou Nunca (1929). It was the movie that turned Gary Cooper into a star (a fact Cooper never forgot; he and Fleming remained friends for life). Fleming's star continued to rise during the '30s, and he was responsible for many of the films that would eventually be considered classics, such as Terra de Paix\u00f5es (1932), Mademoiselle Dinamite (1933), A Ilha do Tesouro (1934), and the two films that were the high marks of his career: ...E o Vento Levou (1939) and O M\u00e1gico de Oz (1939). Ironically Fleming was brought in on both pictures to replace other directors and smooth out the troubled productions, a feat he accomplished masterfully. His career took somewhat of a downturn in the '40s, and most of his films, with the exception of O M\u00e9dico e o Monstro (1941), weren't particularly successful. He ended his career with the troubled production Joana D'Arc (1948), which turned out to be a major critical and financial failure.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            frankfob2@yahoo.com\n          \n\n", "realName": null, "height": "185"},

DeMille as assistant director, Samuel Grosvenor Wood had the good fortune to have assigned to him two of the biggest stars at Paramount during their heyday: Wallace Reid (between 1919 and 1920) and Gloria Swanson (from 1921 to 1923). By the time his seven-year contract with Paramount expired, the former real estate dealer had established himself as one of Hollywood's most reliable (if not individualistic) feature directors. Not bad for a former real estate broker and small-time theatrical thesp. In 1927, Wood joined MGM and remained under contract there until 1939. During this tenure he was very much in sync with the studio's prevalent style of production, reliably turning out between two and three films a year (of which the majority were routine subjects).Most of his films in the 1920s were standard fare and it was not until he directed two gems with The Marx Brothers, Uma Noite na \u00d3pera (1935) and Um Dia nas Corridas (1937) that his career picked up again. Looking at the finished product it is difficult to reconcile this to Groucho Marx finding Wood \"rigid and humourless\". Maybe, this assessment was due to Wood being vociferously right-wing in his personal views which would not have sat well with the famous comedian. His testimonies in 1947 before the House Un-American Activities Committee certainly gained Wood more enemies than friends within the industry.Regardless of his personality or his habitually having to shoot each scene twenty times over, Wood turned out some very powerful dramatic films during the last ten years of his life, beginning with Adeus, Mr. Chips (1939). This popular melodrama earned him his first Academy Award nomination. At RKO, he coaxed an Oscar-winning performance out of Ginger Rogers (and was again nominated himself) for Kitty Foyle (1940). Ronald Reagan gave, arguably, his best performance in Em Cada Cora\u00e7\u00e3o um Pecado (1942) under Wood's direction. His most expensive (and longest, at 170 minutes) assignment took him back to Paramount. This was Ernest Hemingway's Spanish Civil War drama Por Quem os Sinos Dobram (1943), bought for $150,000 (De Mille was originally slated as director). In spite of editorial incongruities and the relatively uneven pace, the picture turned out to be the biggest (and last) hit of Wood's career.Sam Wood died of a heart attack on September 22 1949. He has a star on the Walk of Fame on Hollywood Boulevard.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            I.S.Mowis\n          \n\n", "realName": "Samuel Grosvenor Wood", "height": "183"},

His father was the provincial governor and his mother a member of an aristocratic family of the \"samurai\" class. The young Hayakawa wanted to follow in his father's footsteps and become a career officer in the Japanese navy, but he was turned down due to problems with his hearing. The disappointed Hayakawa decided to make his career on the stage. He joined a Japanese theatrical company that eventually toured the United States in 1913. Pioneering film producer Thomas H. Ince spotted him and offered him a movie contract. Roles in The Wrath of the Gods (1914) and The Typhoon (1914) turned Hayakawa into an overnight success. The first Asian-American star of the American screen was born.He married actress Tsuru Aoki on May 1, 1914. The next year his appearance in Cecil B. DeMille's sexploitation picture Enganar e Perdoar (1915) made Hayakawa a silent-screen superstar. He played an ivory merchant who has an affair with the Caucasian Fannie Ward, and audiences were \"scandalized\" when he branded her as a symbol of her submission to their passion. The movie was a blockbuster for Famous Players-Lasky (later Paramount), turning Hayakawa into a romantic idol for millions of American women, regardless of their race. However, there were objections and outrage from racists of all stripes, especially those who were opposed to miscegenation (sexual contact between those of different races). Also outraged was the Japanese-American community, which was dismayed by DeMille's unsympathetic portrayal of a member of their race. The Japanese-American community protested the film and attempted to have it banned when it was re-released in 1918.The popularity of Hayakawa rivaled that of Caucasian male movie stars in the decade of the 1910s, and he became one of the highest-paid actors in Hollywood. He made his career in melodramas, playing romantic heroes and charismatic heavies. He co-starred with the biggest female stars in Hollywood, all of whom were, of course, Caucasian. His pictures often co-starred Jack Holt as his Caucasian rival for the love of the white heroine (Holt would later become a top action star in the 1920s),Hayakawa left Famous Players-Lasky to go independent, setting up his own production company, Haworth Pictures Corp. Through the end of the decade Haworth produced Asian-themed films starring Hayakawa and wife Tsuru Aoki that proved very popular. These movies elucidated the immigrant's desire to \"cross over\" or assimilate into society at large and pursue the \"American Dream\" in a society free of racial intolerance. Sadly, most of these films are now lost.With the dawn of a new decade came a rise in anti-Asian sentiment, particularly over the issue of immigration due to the post-World War I economic slump. Hayakawa's films began to perform poorly at the box office, bringing his first American movie career to an end in 1922. He moved to Japan but was unable to get a career going. Relocating to France, he starred in La bataille (1923), a popular melodrama spiced with martial arts. He made Sen Yan's Devotion (1924) and The Great Prince Shan (1924) in the UK.In 1931 Hayakawa returned to Hollywood to make his talking-picture debut in support of Anna May Wong in A Filha do Drag\u00e3o (1931). Sound revealed that he had a heavy accent, and his acting got poor reviews. He returned to Japan before once again going to France, where he made the geisha melodrama Yoshiwara (1937) for director Max Oph\u00fcls. He also appeared in a remake of \"The Cheat\" called Marca de Fogo (1937), playing the same role that over 20 year earlier had made him one of the biggest stars in the world.After the Second World War he took a third stab at Hollywood. In 1949 he relaunched g himself as a character actor with Tokyo Joe (1949) in support of Humphrey Bogart, and Feras que Foram Homens (1950) with Claudette Colbert. Hayakawa reached the apex of this, his third career, with his role as the martinet POW camp commandant in A Ponte do Rio Kwai (1957), which brought him an Academy Award nomination for Best Suporting Actor. His performance as Col. Saito was essential to the success of David Lean's film, built as it was around the battle of wills between Hayakawa's commandant and Alec Guinness' Col. Nicholson, head of the Allied POWs. The film won the Best Picture Academy Award, while Lean and Guiness also were rewarded with Oscars.Hayakawa continued to act in movies regularly until his retirement in 1966. He returned to Japan, becoming a Zen Buddhist priest while remaining involved in his craft by giving private acting lessons.Ninety years after achieving stardom, he remains one of the few Asians to assume superstar status in American motion pictures.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Jon C.

His family was of Mexican descent. If Olmos had followed the first love of his life, he would have been a professional baseball player. But by age 13, another love entered his life: rock music. By age 15, he was already an experienced rock singer, forming and reforming several \"garage bands\" along the way. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, he played the most famous clubs on Sunset Strip, including Gazzarri's and The Factory. But a friend suggested that, with his flair for the dramatic, he consider a career in acting. Throughout the 1970s, he divided his time between rock music gigs, acting classes, bit parts in television, Off-off-off Broadway plays and his business of moving fine furniture (which kept body, soul and family together). His first big break was a starring role in Luis Valdez's play, \"Zoot Suit\", in 1978. The play moved to Broadway and led to a Tony Award nomination and great critical acclaim.Perhaps best known for his role as Lt. Martin Castillo in the NBC television series Miami Vice (1984) (1984-1989), Olmos has been seen in numerous film and television productions. He received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor for his starring role in O Pre\u00e7o do Desafio (1988). Most notable of his recent offerings is Am\u00e9rica do Medo (1992), which was also his directing debut. But acting, directing and screenwriting are only parts of what he does. Olmos contends he would much rather be known as an activist than an actor. He devotes much of his time to causes, particularly those focusing on the needs and rights of children. He makes, on average, some 150 personal appearances a year to places where he can reach kids at risk; juvenile halls, detention centers, boys/girls clubs, schools. Anywhere he can get across his message that \"we all have a choice\" about where life takes us.Olmos stresses the importance of education, the risks of gang life and tries to promote the notion of taking responsibility for one's own actions and one's own happiness in life. Using his own \"disadvantaged background\" as an example (he grew up in East Los Angeles, infamous for its gang problems), he tells the kids, \"If I can do it, so can you\".

Born in Pola, Italy (now Croatia), on May 3, 1921, the daughter of a Tridentine journalist and professor and an Istrian homemaker, she studied dramatics as a teen at the Motion Picture Academy of Rome and Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia before snaring bit roles in such films as Il cappello a tre punte (1935) [\"The Three-Cornered Hat\"] and Os Dois Sargentos (1936) [\"The Two Sergeants\"]. She made a name for herself in Italy during WWII playing the title role in Manon Lescaut (1940), won a Venice Film Festival award for Piccolo mondo antico (1941) [\"Little Old World\"] and was a critical sensation in Almas Pecadoras (1942) [\"We the Living\"]. She briefly abandoned her career, however, in 1943, refusing to appear in what she considered fascist propaganda, and was forced into hiding. The next year she married surrealist painter/pianist/composer Oscar De Mejo. They had two children, and one of them, Carlo De Mejo, became an actor. She divorced in 1955, then she came back to Italy,Following her potent, award-winning work in the title role of Eug\u00eania Grandet (1946), she was discovered and contracted by David O. Selznick to play the murder suspect Maddalena Paradine in Alfred Hitchcock's Agonia de Amor (1947). She was billed during her Hollywood years simply as \"Valli,\" and Selznick also gave her top femme female billing in Carol Reed's classic film noir O 3\u00ba Homem (1949), but for every successful film--such as the ones previously mentioned--she experienced such failures as O Milagre dos Sinos (1948), and audiences stayed away. In 1951 she bid farewell to Hollywood and returned to her beloved Italy. In Europe again, she was sought after by the best directors. Her countess in Luchino Visconti's Sedu\u00e7\u00e3o da Carne (1954) was widely heralded, and she moved easily from ing\u00e9nue to vivid character roles.

He spent his early childhood globetrotting with his mother, frequently left in the care of strangers. After attending private school he went on to study drama at RADA (due to his mother's insistence) and was voted best in his class following a performance in \"Much Ado About Nothing\". Spurning a Hollywood contract with Paramount he acted on the West End stage and with the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon from the mid-1930s, specialising in classical plays ranging from \"Hamlet\" and \"Coriolanus\" to \"French without Tears\", by Terence Rattigan. Howard was initially turned down for military service by both the RAF and the British Army but shortage of manpower led to his being called up in 1940 to serve as a second lieutenant with the Army Signal Corps. However, he neither saw action nor accumulated the illustrious wartime record (including winning the Military Cross) invented for him by his publicists. A 2001 biography by Terence Pettigrew claimed to have unearthed files from his war record which alleged that he was dismissed from service in 1943 due to 'mental instability'. Ironically, on screen, the actor was often cast as solid, unflappable British officers, perhaps reflecting his own personal credo of always feeling best when impersonating someone else.Howard's career in films began quietly with small roles in T\u00eampera de A\u00e7o (1944) and Al\u00e9m das Nuvens (1945). He unexpectedly leapt to stardom in just his third outing as the stoic, decent Dr. Alec Harvey in David Lean's melancholic story of middle-class wartime romance, Desencanto (1945). Howard's mannered performance perfectly suited the required stiff-upper-lip mood of the film, his intensity and projected integrity more than compensating for his average looks. That 'jolly decent chap' persona continued on in another 'woman's picture', A Hist\u00f3ria de uma Mulher (1949), but Howard soon found his niche in more determined, worldly roles. He later admitted that \"for years I was practically hounded by my first part in Brief Encounter. I loved the film, mind you, but the role wasn't me, at all\" (Ottawa Citizen, February 17 1961). As a screen actor, Howard came of age in crime thrillers and war films, delivering his first genuine tour de force performance as a battle-hardened, cynical ex-pilot caught up in the world of post-war black market racketeering in Nas Garras da Fatalidade (1947). His efficient, by-the-book intelligence officer, Major Calloway, in Carol Reed's O 3\u00ba Homem (1949) put him firmly on the map as a star character player.Rasping-voiced and becoming increasingly craggy as the years went by, Howard contrasted archetypal authoritarians (seasoned army veteran Captain Thomson of Os Sobreviventes (1955), Captain William Bligh in the remake of O Grande Motim (1962), Lord Cardigan in A Carga da Brigada Ligeira (1968)) with weaklings (best exemplified by morally corrupt, degenerate expatriate trader Peter Willems in O P\u00e1ria das Ilhas (1951) -- arguably one of Howard's finest performances); sympathetic victims (colonial cop Scobie, tormented by religious guilt in The Heart of the Matter (1953)) and obsessive, driven eccentrics (crusading elephant preservationist Morel in Ra\u00edzes do C\u00e9u (1958), the alcoholic, haunted Sir Henry at Rawlinson End (1980), and the weird Russian recluse of A Anos-Luz (1981)). In the midst of angst-ridden heroes, drunken clerics and assorted historical characters, ranging from Napoleon Bonaparte to Sir Isaac Newton, Howard even essayed a Cheyenne warrior returning from the dead to defend his family in O Guerreiro do Vento (1980). Remarkably, though he took on a score of eminently forgettable projects, it is difficult to fault a single one of his performances. Throughout his entire career he was never out of favour with audiences and never out of work.As becoming one of the most British of actors, Howard was an ardent cricket supporter, member of the prestigious Marylebone Cricket Club. He insisted on having a clause inserted in his contracts which allowed him leave from filming to attend test matches. A rather solitary man, he had few other hobbies (except, perhaps, a fondness for alcohol, which likely contributed to his death at the age of 74) and was reputedly modest about his accomplishments as an actor. He once declared \"we don't have the Method School of acting in England. We simply read the script, let it seep in, then go put on whiskers - and do it\" (New York Times, January 8 1988).\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            I.S.Mowis\n          \n\n", "realName": "Trevor Wallace Howard-Smith", "height": "178"},

Reed was one of Tree's six illegitimate children with Beatrice Mae Pinney, who Tree established in a second household apart from his married life. There were no social scars here; Reed grew up in a well-mannered, middle-class atmosphere. His public school days were at King's School, Canterbury, and he was only too glad to push on with the idea of following his father and becoming an actor. His mother wanted no such thing and shipped him off to Massachusetts in 1922, where his older brother resided on--of all things--a chicken ranch.It was a wasted six months before Reed was back in England and joined a stage company of Dame Sybil Thorndike, making his stage debut in 1924. He forthwith met British writer Edgar Wallace, who cashed in on his constant output of thrillers by establishing a road troupe to do stage adaptations of them. Reed was in three of these, also working as an assistant stage manager. Wallace became chairman of the newly formed British Lion Film Corp. in 1927, and Reed followed to become his personal assistant. As such he began learning the film trade by assisting in supervising the filmed adaptations of Wallace's works. This was essentially his day job. At night he continued stage acting and managing. It was something of a relief when Wallace passed on in 1932; Reed decided to drop the stage for film and joined historic Ealing Studios as dialog director for Associated Talking Pictures under Basil Dean.Reed rose from dialog director to second-unit director and assistant director in record time, his first solo directorship being the adventure Midshipman Easy (1935). This and his subsequent effort, Laburnum Grove (1936), attracted high praise from a future collaborator, novelist/critic Graham Greene, who said that once Reed \"gets the right script, [he] will prove far more than efficient.\" However, Reed would endure the sort of staid, boilerplate filmmaking that characterized British \"B\" movies until he left this behind with Sob a Luz das Estrelas (1940), his second film with Michael Redgrave, and his openly Hitchcockian Gestapo (1940), a comedy-thriller with Rex Harrison. It has often been seen as a sequel to Alfred Hitchcock's A Dama Oculta (1938) with the same screenwriters and comedy relief--Basil Radford and Naunton Wayne, who would just about make careers as the cricket zealots Charters and Caldicott, from \"Vanishes\".The British liked these films and, significantly, so did America, where Hollywood still wondered whether their patronage of the British film industry was worth the gamble of a payoff via the US public. Dean was just one of several powerhouse producers rising in Britain in the 1930s. Other names are more familiar: Alexander Korda and J. Arthur Rank stand out. For Reed, who would wisely decide to start producing his own films in order to have more control over them, finding his niche was still a challenge into the 1940s. He was only too well aware that the film director led a team effort--his was partly a coordinator's task, harmonizing the talents of the creative team. The modest Reed would admit to his success being this partnership time and again. So he gravitated toward the same scriptwriters, art directors and cinematographers as his movie list spread out.There were more thrillers and some historical bios: Kipps (1941) with Redgrave and O Jovem Mr. Pitt (1942) with Robert Donat. He did service and war effort fare through World War II, but these were more than flag wavers, for Reed dealt with the psychology of transitioning to military life. His Anglo-American documentary of combat (co-directed by Garson Kanin), Verdadeira Gl\u00f3ria (1945), won the 1946 Oscar for Best Documentary. With that under his belt, Reed was now recognized as Britain's ablest director and could pick and choose his projects. He also had the clout--and the all-important funds--to do what he thought was essential to ensure realism on a location shoot, something missing in British film work prior to Reed.Condenado (1947) with James Mason as an IRA hit man on the run did just that and was Reed's first real independent effort, and he had gone to Rank to do it. All too soon, however, that organization began subjugating directors' wishes to studio needs, and Reed made perhaps his most important associative decision and joined Korda's London Films. Here was one very important harmony--he and Korda thought along the same lines. Though Anthony Kimmins had scripted four films for Reed, it was time for Korda to introduce the director to Graham Greene. Their association would bring Reed his greatest successes. O \u00cddolo Ca\u00eddo (1948) was based on a Greene short story, with Ralph Richardson as a do-everything head butler in a diplomatic household. Idolized by the lonely, small son of his employer, he becomes caught up in a liaison with a woman on the work staff, who was much younger than his shrewish wife. It may seem slow to an American audience, but with the focus on the boy's wide-eyed view of rather gloomy surroundings, as well as the adult drama around him, it was innovative and a solid success.What came next was a landmark--the best known of Reed's films. O 3\u00ba Homem (1949) was yet another Greene story, molded into a gem of a screenplay by him, though Reed added some significant elements of his own. The film has been endlessly summarized and analyzed and, whether defined as an international noir or post-war noir or just noir, it was cutting-edge noir and unforgettable. This was Reed in full control--well, almost-- and the money was coming from yet another wide-vision producer, David O. Selznick, along with Korda. Tension did develop in this effort keep a predominantly Anglo effort in this Anglo-American collaboration.There were complications, though. For one thing, Korda--old friend and somewhat kindred spirit of wunderkind director Orson Welles--had a gentlemen's agreement with the latter for three pictures, but these were not forthcoming. Korda could be as evasive as Welles was known to be, and Welles had come to Europe to further his inevitable film projects after troubles in Hollywood. Always desperate for seed money, Welles was forced to take acting parts in Europe to build up his bank account in order to finance his more personal projects. He thus accepted the role of the larger-than-life American flim-flam man turned criminal, Harry Lime. The extended time spent filming the Vienna sewer scenes on location and at the elaborate set for them at Shepperton Studios in London, entailed the longest of the ten minutes or so of Welles' screen time. Here was a potential source of directorial intimidation if ever there was one. Welles took it upon himself to direct Reed's veteran cinematographer Robert Krasker with his own vision of some sewer sequences in London (after leaving the location shoot in Vienna), using many takes. Supposedly, Reed did not use any of Welles' footage, and in fact whatever there was got conveniently lost. Yet Cidad\u00e3o Kane (1941)'s shadow was so looming that Welles was given credit for a lot of camera work, atmospherics and the chase scenes. He had referred to the movie as \"my film\" later on and had said he wrote all his dialog. Some of the ferris wheel dialog with its famous famous \"cuckoo clock\" speech (which Reed and Greene both attributed to him) was probably the essence of Welles' contributions.Krasker's quirky angles under Reed's direction perfectly framed the ready-made-for-an-art designer bombed-out shadows and stark, isolated street lights of postwar Vienna and its underworld. Unique to cinema history, the whole score (except for some canned incidental caf\u00e9 music) was just the brilliant zither playing of Anton Karas, adding his nuances to every dramatic transition. Krasker won an Oscar, and Karas was nominated for one.Reed's attention to detailed casting also paid off, particularly in casting German-speaking actors and background players. Selznick insisted on Joseph Cotten as Holly Martins, the benighted protagonist, and his clipped and sharp voice and subterranean drawl were perfect for the part. Reed had wanted James Stewart--definitely a different perception than Americans of its leading men. Selznick parted ways with Reed on other issues, however; there was a laundry list of reasons for his re-editing and changing some incidentals for the shorter American version, partly based on negative comments from sneak preview responses. Perhaps it was the constant interruptions from the other side of the Atlantic that drove Reed to personally narrate the introduction describing Martins in the British version of the film (given the basic tenets of noir films, the star always played narrator to introduce the story and voice over where appropriate). Selznick showed himself--in this instance, anyway--to have a better directorial sense by substituting Cotten introducing himself in the American cut. It made far more sense and was much more effective. On the other hand, Selznick's editing of the pivotal railway caf\u00e9 scenes with Cotten and Alida Valli had continuity problems.Nonetheless, the film was an international smash, and all the principal players reaped the rewards. Reed did not get an Oscar, but he did win the Cannes Film Grand Prix. Greene was motivated enough to take the story and expand it into a best-selling novel. Even Welles, with his minimum screen time--he was spending most of his time in Europe trying to obtain financing for his newest project, Otelo, O Mouro de Veneza (1956)--milked the movie for all it was worth. He did not deny directorial influences (though in a 1984 interview he did), and even developed a Harry Lime radio show back home.However, the movie had its detractors. It was called too melodramatic and too cynical. The short scenes of untranslated German dialog were also criticized, yet that lent to the atmosphere of confusion and helplessness of Martins caught in a wary, potentially dangerous environment--something the audience inevitably was able to share. It was all too ironic that Reed, now declared by some as the greatest living director of the time, found his career in decline thereafter. Of his total output, four were based on plays, three on stories and 15 on novels. With less than half of them to go, he was to be disappointed for the most part. His O Outro Homem (1953) with James Mason was too much of a \"Third Man\" reprise, and A Rua da Esperan\u00e7a (1955) was too sentimental.By now Reed was being sought by enterprising Hollywood producers. He had--as he usually did--the material for a first-rate movie with two popular American actors, Burt Lancaster and Tony Curtis for Trap\u00e9zio (1956). However, it suffered from a slow script, as would the British-produced A Chave (1958), despite another international cast. Things finally picked up with his venture into another Greene-scripted film from his novel, with Alec Guinness in the lead in the UK spy spoof O Nosso Homem em Havana (1959) with yet another winning international cast.When Hollywood called again, the chance at such a British piece of history as O Grande Motim (1962) with a mostly British cast and Marlon Brando seemed bound for success. It was the second version of the movie produced by MGM (the first being the Clark Gable starrer O Grande Motim (1935)). However, Brando's history of being temperamental was much in evidence on location in Tahiti. Reed shot a small part of the picture but finally left, having more than his fill of the star's ego (and, evidently, being allowed too much artistic control by the studio) and the film was finished by Lewis Milestone. Reed would ultimately be branded as a failure in directing historical movies, but it was an unfair appraisal based on the random aspect of film success and such forces of nature as Brando, not artistic and technical expertise.The opportunity to make another film came knocking again with Reed and American money forming the production company International Classics to produce Irving Stone's best-selling story of Michelangelo and the painting of the Sistine Chapel, Agonia e \u00caxtase (1965). Here is perhaps the prime example of Reed being given short shrift for a really valiant effort at an historical, artistically significant and cultural epic because it was a \"flop\" at the box office. Shot on location in Rome and its environs, the film had a first-rate cast headed by Charlton Heston doing his method best as the temperamental artist with Rex Harrison, an effortless standout as the equally volatile Pope Julius II. Diane Cilento did fine work as the Contessina de Medici, with the always stalwart Harry Andrews as architect rival Donato Bramante. Most of the other roles were filled by Italians dubbed in English, but they all look good.Reed's attention to historical detail provided perhaps the most accurate depiction of early 16th-century Italy--from costumes and manners to military action and weapons (especially firearms)--ever brought to the screen. The script by Philip Dunne was brisk and always entertaining in the verbal battle between the artist and his pontiff. Yet by the 1960s costume epics were going out of style and bigger flops, such as Cle\u00f3patra (1963) (talk about agony) despite the wealth of stars which included Harrison, tended to spread like a disease to those few that came later. Despite a high-powered distribution campaign by Twentieth Century-Fox, Reed's exemplary effort would ultimately be appreciated by art scholars and historians--not the stuff of Hollywood's money mentality.For Reed the only remaining triumph was, of all things, a musical--his first and only--yet again he was working with children. However, the adaptation of the great Charles Dickens novel \"Oliver Twistt\" top the screen (as Oliver! (1968)) was a sensation with a lively script and music amid a realistic 19th-century London that was up to Reed's usual standards. The film was nominated for no less than 11 Oscars, wining five and two of the big ones--Best Picture and Best Director. Reed had finally achieved that bit of elusiveness. He could never be so simplistically stamped with an uneven career; Reed had always kept to a precise craftsman's movie-making formula.Fellow British director Michael Powell had said that Reed \"could put a film together like a watchmaker puts together a watch\". It was Graham Greene, however, who gave Reed perhaps the more important personal accolade: \"The only director I know with that particular warmth of human sympathy, the extraordinary feeling for the right face in the right part, the exactitude of cutting, and not least important the power of sympathizing with an author's worries and an ability to guide him.\"\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            William McPeak (qv's & corrections by A.

Dern was exposed to movie sets and the movie industry from infancy, and obtained several bit parts as a child. Her parents divorced when Dern was two and Dern lost contact with her father for several years as a result.Her parents' background and her own early taste of the moviemaking world soon convinced the young Dern to pursue acting herself. Like so many young actors, her decision may have been influenced by social awkwardness -- the child of 60s counterculture parents, she was steeped in Eastern mysticism and political radicalism, and was seen as an oddball by her more conservative classmates. Her gawky physical appearance didn't help - even before her teens, she had achieved most of her impressive 5' 10\" height, was rail-skinny (other than precociously wide hips), had huge feet and a slouching posture, and for all this was often teased by classmates. Perhaps the nine-year-old Dern found refuge by studying acting at the Lee Strasberg Theater Institute.The first success for the young Dern came in 1980, with a role in Adrian Lyne's Gatinhas (1980), a teen movie starring Jodie Foster. She followed this with several small parts, or parts in small movies, such as Ladies and Gentlemen, the Fabulous Stains (1982) and Escola da Desordem (1984), as a student who has an affair with a teacher. (Her mother objected to her active presence on movie sets at age thirteen, which required Dern to sue for emancipation so she could play her role in \"The Fabulous Stains\"). Her next roles, as the blind girl who befriends the deformed boy in Marcas do Destino (1985), and as a teenaged girl whose sexual awakening collides with a mysterious older man in Conversa Suave (1985), gave her career an important boost. Dern appeared to have made it with a leading role in David Lynch's acclaimed Veludo Azul (1986), but it was four years before her next notable film, and this was the bizarre Cora\u00e7\u00e3o Selvagem (1990), also directed by Lynch.The following year, Dern starred in As Noites de Rose (1991), which would become her signature performance, as a sexually-precocious, free-spirited young housemaid in the South in the 1930s. Dern earned an Oscar nomination for her performance, and so did her mother and co-star, Diane Ladd. Dern continues to win prominent roles on the big screen, often in smaller, highly-regarded human dramas such as O C\u00e9u de Outubro (1999), Uma Li\u00e7\u00e3o de Amor (2001) and Tenta\u00e7\u00e3o (2004), although she is perhaps most widely known for her repeat role as Ellie Sattler in the summer adventure movies Jurassic Park: O Parque dos Dinossauros (1993) and Jurassic Park III (2001), or for her guest performance on Ellen (1994), as the woman to whom Ellen finally comes out as a lesbian.Dern's pre-teen gawkiness matured into lithe beauty, but this doesn't prevent Dern from fearlessly throwing herself into a wide variety of roles which are sometimes unflattering, an excellent example being her unflinchingly comic portrayal of an intensely annoying loser whose pregnancy becomes a social and political football in Ruth em Quest\u00e3o (1996). This results in Dern being one of the most interesting actors working in Hollywood today.Having previously dated such Hollywood talent as Treat Williams, Renny Harlin, Kyle MacLachlan, Jeff Goldblum and Billy Bob Thornton, Dern eventually married musician Ben Harper in 2005. Early in her career, Dern was roommate to Marianne Williamson, the spirituality guru. Dern attended two days of college at UCLA and one semester at USC.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Larry-115\n          \n\n", "realName": "Laura Elizabeth Dern", "height": "178"},

Goldblum, a doctor. His father was of Russian Jewish descent and his mother was of Austrian Jewish ancestry.Goldblum began his career on the New York stage after moving to the city at age seventeen. Possessing his own unique style of delivery, Goldblum made an impression on moviegoers with little more than a single line in Woody Allen's Noivo Neur\u00f3tico, Noiva Nervosa (1977), when he fretted about having forgotten his mantra. Goldblum went on to appear in the remake Invasores de Corpos (1978) and co-starred with Ben Vereen in the detective series Tenspeed and Brown Shoe (1980) before a high-profile turn in the classic ensemble film O Reencontro (1983).The quirky actor turned up in the suitably quirky film As Aventuras de Buckaroo Banzai (1984), which became a 1980s cult classic, starred in the modern-day film noir Um Romance Muito Perigoso (1985), then went on to a breakthrough role in the David Cronenberg remake A Mosca (1986), which also featured actress Geena Davis, Goldblum's wife from 1987-1990 and co-star in two additional films: Transilv\u00e2nia - Hotel do Outro Lado do Mundo (1985) and Julien Temple's Meu Amante \u00e9 de Outro Mundo (1988).Goldblum was the rather unlikely star of some of the biggest blockbusters of the 1990s: Steven Spielberg's dinosaur adventure Jurassic Park: O Parque dos Dinossauros (1993) and its sequel O Mundo Perdido: Jurassic Park (1997), as well as the alien invasion film Independence Day (1996). These films saw Goldblum playing the type of intellectual characters he has become associated with. More recently, roles have included critically acclaimed turns in A Estranha Fam\u00edlia de Igby (2002) and Wes Anderson's A Vida Marinha com Steve Zissou (2004).

After graduating from high school in the nearby steel town of Gary, Indiana, Malden worked in the industry for three years until 1934, when he was frustrated with the drudgery of manual labor. He left to attend the Arkansas State Teacher's College, then the Goodman Theater Dramatic School and never looked back. Three years later, he went to New York City to find fame.Malden rapidly became involved with the Group Theater, an organization of actors and directors who were changing the face of theater, where he attracted the attention of director Elia Kazan. With Kazan directing, Karl starred in plays such as \"All My Sons\" by Arthur Miller and \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" by Tennessee Williams. While Malden had one screen appearance before his military service in World War II, in N\u00e3o Cobi\u00e7ar\u00e1s a Mulher Alheia (1940), he did not establish his film career until after the war. Malden won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor as Mitch in Uma Rua Chamada Pecado (1951) and showed his range as an actor in roles such as that of Father Corrigan in Sindicato de Ladr\u00f5es (1954) and the lecherous Archie Lee in Boneca de Carne (1956).He starred in dozens of films such as Vencendo o Medo (1957), Pollyanna (1960), O Homem de Alcatraz (1962), Em Busca de um Sonho (1962), A Conquista do Oeste (1962), A Mesa do Diabo (1965), and Patton, Rebelde ou Her\u00f3i? (1970) as General Omar Bradley. In the early 1970s, he built a television career on the tough but honest screen persona he had created when he starred as Detective Mike Stone on The Streets of San Francisco (1972), co-starring with Michael Douglas. He also became the pitchman for American Express, a position he held for 21 years. In 1988, he was elected President of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, a position he held for five years. Following that he, published his memoir entitled, \"When Do I Start?: A Memoir\", written with his daughter Carla.Malden also courted controversy by pushing for a special salute to Elia Kazan at the 1999 Academy Awards. Malden defended both Kazan and the award, arguing that Kazan's artistic achievements outshone any shame attached to Kazan's naming names before the Congressional committee investigating Communists in Hollywood. Marlon Brando refused to give Kazan the statuette; Robert De Niro ultimately did. Karl Malden died at age 97 of natural causes at his home in Los Angeles on July 1, 2009. He was buried at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Westwood, California.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Henry Willis\n          \n\n", "realName": "Mladen George Sekulovich", "height": "185"},

He was of German and Austrian ancestry. After his parents' divorce, Steiger was raised by his mother in Newark, New Jersey. He dropped out of Westside High school at age 16 and joined the Navy. He saw action in the Pacific on a destroyer. Steiger returned to New Jersey after the war and worked for the VA. He was part of an amateur acting group, and then joined the Actors' Studio using his GI Bill benefits.Steiger received his first film roles in the early 1950s. His first major one was in Teresa (1951), but his first lead role was in the TV version of The Philco Television Playhouse: Marty (1953). The movie version, however, had Ernest Borgnine in the lead and won him an Academy Award. Steiger's breakthrough role came in 1954, with the classic Sindicato de Ladr\u00f5es (1954). Since then he has been a presence on the screen as everything from a popular leading man to a little-known character actor. Steiger made a name for himself in many different types of roles, from a crooked promoter in A Tr\u00e1gica Farsa (1956) to the title character in Al Capone (1959). He was one of dozens of stars in the epic World War II film O Mais Longo dos Dias (1962). In 1964, he received his second Oscar nomination for O Homem do Prego (1964). The next couple of years he was at the height of his powers. In 1965, he starred in the dark comedy O Ente Querido (1965), and in David Lean's epic Doutor Jivago (1965). In 1966, he starred in the BBC Play of the Month (1965) episode \"Death of a Salesman\" as Willy Loman in the TV version of his stage play \"Death of a Salesman,\" but in 1967, he landed what many consider his greatest role: Sheriff Bill Gillespie in No Calor da Noite (1967), opposite Sidney Poitier. Steiger deservedly took home the Best Actor Oscar for his work in that film.He took another controversial role as a man with many tattoos in Uma Sombra Passou por Aqui (1969) and as a serial killer in the classic Uma Face para Cada Crime (1968). After that, he seemed to have withdrawn from high-profile movies and became more selective in the roles he chose. He turned down the lead in Patton, Rebelde ou Her\u00f3i? (1970) and also in O Poderoso Chef\u00e3o (1972). Among his more notable roles in the 1970s are Feliz Anivers\u00e1rio, Wanda June (1971), Quando o \u00d3dio Explode (1973), as Benito Mussolini in Mussolini - Ascens\u00e3o e Gl\u00f3ria de um Ditador (1974), Retrato de um Assassino (1979), Jesus de Nazar\u00e9 (1977), F.I.S.T. (1978) and Terror em Amityville (1979). He starred in the critically acclaimed A Escolha (1981) with Robby Benson and Maximilian Schell, perhaps the highlight of his 1980s movie career. Steiger increasingly moved away from the big Hollywood pictures, instead taking roles in foreign productions and independent movies. As the 1980s ended, Steiger landed a role as the buttoned-up New York City Chief of Police in O Calend\u00e1rio da Morte (1989).Steiger was seriously affected by depression for 8 years. As he returned to the screen in the late 1990s he began creating some of his most memorable roles. He was the doctor in the independently-made movie Shiloh: O Melhor Amigo (1996), about an abused dog. He was the crazed, kill-'em-all army general in Marte Ataca! (1996) who always called his enemies peace-mongers. He took a small part as a Supreme Court judge in Hurricane, o Furac\u00e3o (1999) and as a preacher in the badly produced film Fim dos Dias (1999). He was still active in films moving into the new millennium.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Scott Adams (msa0510@mail.ecu.edu) and kenn_honeyman\n          \n\n", "realName": "Rodney Stephan Steiger", "height": "178"},

Noted for drawing out the best dramatic performances from his actors, he directed 21 actors to Oscar nominations, resulting in nine wins. He directed a string of successful films, including Uma Rua Chamada Pecado (1951), Sindicato de Ladr\u00f5es (1954), and Vidas Amargas (1955). During his career, he won two Oscars as Best Director and received an Honorary Oscar, won three Tony Awards, and four Golden Globe Awards.His films were concerned with personal or social issues of special concern to him. Kazan writes, \"I don't move unless I have some empathy with the basic theme.\" His first such \"issue\" film was A Luz \u00e9 para Todos (1947), with Gregory Peck, which dealt with anti-Semitism in America. It received 8 Oscar nominations and three wins, including Kazan's first for Best Director. It was followed by O que a Carne Herda (1949), one of the first films in mainstream Hollywood to address racial prejudice against black people. Uma Rua Chamada Pecado (1951), an adaptation of the stage play which he had also directed, received 12 Oscar nominations, winning four, and was Marlon Brando's breakthrough role. In 1954, he directed Sindicato de Ladr\u00f5es (1954), a film about union corruption on the New York harbor waterfront. In 1955, he directed John Steinbeck's Vidas Amargas (1955), which introduced James Dean to movie audiences.A turning point in Kazan's career came with his testimony as a witness before the House Committee on Un-American Activities in 1952 at the time of the Hollywood blacklist, which brought him strong negative reactions from many liberal friends and colleagues. His testimony helped end the careers of former acting colleagues Morris Carnovsky and Art Smith, along with ending the work of playwright Clifford Odets. Kazan later justified his act by saying he took \"only the more tolerable of two alternatives that were either way painful and wrong.\" Nearly a half-century later, his anti-Communist testimony continued to cause controversy. When Kazan was awarded an honorary Oscar in 1999, dozens of actors chose not to applaud as 250 demonstrators picketed the event.Kazan influenced the films of the 1950s and 1960s with his provocative, issue-driven subjects. Director Stanley Kubrick called him, \"without question, the best director we have in America, and capable of performing miracles with the actors he uses.\" On September 28, 2003, Elia Kazan died at age 94 of natural causes at his apartment in Manhattan, New York City. Martin Scorsese co-directed the documentary film A Letter to Elia (2010) as a personal tribute to Kazan.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Henry Willis\n          \n\n", "realName": "Elias Kazancioglu", "height": "173"},

Her parents divorced when she was 16 years old. Her mother remarried, and her new husband, salesman Roy Gruessendorf, moved the family to Atlanta, Texas.After graduating from Atlanta High School in 1976, Ellen attended the University of New Orleans as a communications major, but she dropped out after one semester. She held a wide variety of jobs until she turned to stand-up comedy, making her bones at small clubs and coffeehouses before working her way up to emcee Clyde's Comedy Club by 1981. Her comedy was described as a distaff version of Bob Newhart. Beginning in the early 1980s, she toured nationally and was named the funniest person in America after winning a competition sponsored by the cable network Showtime. This led to better gigs, including her first appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962) in 1986.Though DeGeneres's early forays into series television were not successful (she appeared as a supporting player in two short-lived TV situation comedies in the period 1989-92, Open House (1989) and Laurie Hill (1992)), she scored a hit headlining her own 1994 sitcom on ABC \"These Friends of Mine\" (renamed Ellen (1994) after its first season). She made TV history in April 1997, when her character, and DeGeneres personally, revealed that she was a lesbian. However, the show was canceled the following season due to declining ratings, after which DeGeneres returned to the stand-up circuit. In 2001, DeGeneres launched a new series, The Ellen Show (2001), on CBS, but it suffered from poor ratings and was canceled.Redemption as a television artist came in 2003, when DeGeneres's daytime talk show, Ellen: The Ellen DeGeneres Show (2003), proved to be both a critical hit and a commercial success. Along with good ratings, the show has won unprecedented kudos from the industry, winning 15 Emmy Awards in its first three seasons on the air and becoming the first talk show in TV history to win the Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show in its first three seasons.DeGeneres has also made a name for herself as a host of awards shows. She hosted the Grammy Awards in 1996 and 1997, as well as the Primetime Emmy Awards in 2001 and 2005.

His artistic curiosity in exploring the human condition leads him to projects all over the world, large and small, Hollywood films as well as Independent cinema.In 1979, he was given a role in Michael's Cimino's Heaven's Gate, from which he was fired. Since then, he has collaborated with directors who represent a virtual encyclopedia of modern cinema: Kathryn Bigelow, Sam Raimi, Alan Parker, Walter Hill, Mary Harron, Wim Wenders, Anton Corbijn, Zhang Yimou, Wes Anderson, Martin Scorsese, David Lynch, Oliver Stone, William Friedkin, Werner Herzog, Lars Von Trier, Abel Ferrara, Spike Lee, Julian Schnabel, David Cronenberg, Paul Schrader, Anthony Minghella, Scott Cooper, Theo Angelopoulos, Christian Carion, Robert Rodriguez, Phillip Noyce, Hector Babenco, John Milius, Roger Donaldson, Paul McGuigan, Lee Tamahori, Roger Spottiswoode, Paul Weitz, Daniel Nettheim, The Spierig Brothers, Andrew Stanton, and Josh Boone.Dafoe has been recognized with four Academy Award nominations: Best Actor in a Supporting Role for Platoon, Best Actor in a Supporting Role for Shadow Of The Vampire, for which he also received Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild nominations, Best Actor in a Supporting Role for The Florida Project, for which he also received Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild nominations, and most recently, Best Leading Actor for At Eternity's Gate, for which he also received a Golden Globe nomination. Among his other nominations and awards, he has received two Los Angeles Film Critics Awards, a New York Film Critics Circle Award, a National Board of Review Award, an Independent Spirit Award, Venice Film Festival Volpi Cup, as well as a Berlinale Honorary Golden Bear for Lifetime Achievement.Willem was born in Appleton, Wisconsin, to Muriel Isabel (Sprissler), a nurse, and William Alfred Dafoe, a surgeon. He is of mostly German, Irish, Scottish, and English descent. He and his wife, director Giada Colagrande, have made three films together: Padre, A Woman, and Before It Had A Name.His natural adventurousness is evident in roles as diverse as the elite assassin who is mentor to Keanu Reeves in the neo-noir John Wick, in his voice work as Gil the Moorish Idol in Finding Nemo and as Ryuk the Death God in Death Note, and as the obsessed FBI agent in the cult classic The Boondock Saints, Sean Baker's The Florida Project and Kenneth Branagh's Murder on the Orient Express. That adventurous spirit continues with upcoming films including James Wan's Aquaman, Robert Eggers's The Lighthouse, Edward Norton's Motherless Brooklyn and Julian Schnabel's At Eternity's Gate in which he stars as Vincent Van Gogh.Dafoe is one of the founding members of The Wooster Group, the New York based experimental theatre collective.

His influence lives on in the work of Ingmar Bergman and all those directors, both Swedish and international, influenced by his work and the works of directors whom he himself influenced.As a boy Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m was close to his mother, who died during childbirth when he was seven years old. Biographers see this truncated relationship as being essential to the evolution of his dramatic trope of strong-willed, independent women in his films. He was masterful at eliciting sensitive performances from actresses, such as that of Lillian Gish in his American classic Vento e Areia (1928).The teenaged Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m loved the theater, but after his education he turned to business, becoming a donut salesman. Fortunately for the future of Swedish cinema, he was a flop as a salesman, and turned to the theater, becoming an actor and then director. The Swedish film company Svenska Bio hired him and fellow stage director Mauritz Stiller to helm pictures, and from 1912-15 he directed 31 films. Only three of them survive (it is estimated that approximately 150,000 films, or 80% of the total silent-era production, has been lost). He directed Ingeborg Holm (1913), considered the first classic of Swedish cinema.Despite the exigencies of working in an industrial art form, most Svenska Bio films of this period are embarrassments in an artistic sense--turgid melodramas, absurd romances and shaggy dog-style comedies--and there is no reason to think that the director didn't helm his share of such fare. Even taking that into account, Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m managed to develop a personal style. The reason he became internationally famous (and wooed by Hollywood) was the richness of his films, which were full of psychological subtleties and natural symbolism that was integrated into the works as a whole. He dealt with such major themes as guilt, redemption and the rapidly evolving place of women in society.His 1920 film A Carruagem Fantasma (1921) (a.k.a. \"Thy Soul Shall Bear Witness\") was an internationally acclaimed masterpiece, and Goldwyn Pictures hired him to direct Name the Man! (1924) (Goldwayn was folded into Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1924, where he worked until shortly after the advent of sound). Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m's name was changed to \"Victor Seastrom\" (a phonetic pronunciation in a country with limited word fonts), and he became a major American director, a pro-to David Lean, who was renowned for balancing artistic expression with a concern for what would play at the box office. His first MGM film was the Lon Chaney melodrama Ironia da Sorte (1924). It was not only a critical success but a huge hit, getting the new studio off onto a sound footing.He was highly respected by MGM chief Louis B. Mayer and by production head Irving Thalberg, who shared Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m's concerns with art that did not exclude profit. Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m became one of the most highly paid directors in Hollywood, reaching his peak at the end of the silent era (when the silent film reached its maturation as an art form) with two collaborations with Lillian Gish: A Letra Escarlate (1926) and \"The Wind\" (1926), his last masterpiece.He departed Hollywood for Sweden after Mulher Ideal (1930), returning one last time to helm O Poder de Richelieu (1937) for 20th Century-Fox, and although he made two movies in Sweden in the intervening years, his career as a director basically ended with the sound era. He returned to his first avocation, acting in Swedish films, in the 1930s, '40s and '50s. In his later years he was a mentor to Ingmar Bergman and gave a remarkable performance in Bergman's masterpiece \"Wild Strawberries\" (1957), for which he won the National Board of Review's Best Actor Award. In his professional life he was a workaholic, and in his private life was reticent about his films and his fame and remained intensely devoted to his wife Edith Erastoff and his family.Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m died on January 3, 1960, at the age of 80.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Jon C.

He won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor for his performance in O Franco Atirador (1978), and has been seen in mostly character roles, often portraying psychologically unstable individuals, though that generalization would not do justice to Walken's depth and breadth of performances.Walken was born in Astoria, Queens, New York. His mother, Rosalie (Russell), was a Scottish emigrant, from Glasgow. His father, Paul W\u00e4lken, was a German emigrant, from Horst, who ran Walken's bakery. Christopher learned his stage craft, including dancing, at Hofstra University & ANTA, and picked up a Theatre World award for his performance in the revival of the Tennessee Williams play \"The Rose Tattoo\". Walken then first broke through into cinema in 1969 appearing in Me and My Brother (1969), before appearing alongside Sean Connery in the sleeper heist movie O Golpe de John Anderson (1971). His eclectic work really came to the attention of critics in 1977 with his intense portrayal of Diane Keaton suicidal younger brother in Noivo Neur\u00f3tico, Noiva Nervosa (1977), and then he scooped the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award in 1977 for his role as Nick in the electrifying O Franco Atirador (1978). Walken was lured back by O Franco Atirador (1978) director Michael Cimino for a role in the financially disastrous western Portal do Para\u00edso (1980), before moving onto surprise audiences with his wonderful dance skills in Dinheiro do C\u00e9u (1981), taking the lead as a school teacher with telepathic abilities in the Stephen King inspired Na Hora da Zona Morta (1983) and then as billionaire industrialist Max Zorin trying to blow up Silicon Valley in the 007 adventure 007 - Na Mira dos Assassinos (1985). Looking at many of Walken's other captivating screen roles, it is easy to see the diversity of his range and even his droll comedic talents with humorous appearances in Metido em Encrencas (1988), Quanto Mais Idiota Melhor 2 (1993), Joe Sujo (2001), Um Ratinho Encrenqueiro (1997) and Os Queridinhos da Am\u00e9rica (2001). Most recently, he continued to surprise audiences again with his work as a heart broken and apologetic father to Leonardo DiCaprio in Prenda-me se for Capaz (2002).\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Andr\u00e9 Hansson <andreh@hawkan.pp.se> and firehouse44\n          \n\n", "realName": "Ronald Walken", "height": "183"},

But before his film debut, the short The American Way (1962), he won numerous Obie Awards for his stage performances in \"The Indian Wants the Bronx\" and \"The Line\".Cazale scored the role of Fredo Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola's O Poderoso Chef\u00e3o (1972), after his long time friend, Al Pacino, invited him to audition. He reprised his role as the troubled Fredo in O Poderoso Chef\u00e3o II (1974), where his character endures one of the most infamous movie moments in the history of cinema.Cazale also starred with Gene Hackman and Harrison Ford in the thriller, A Conversa\u00e7\u00e3o (1974), as Hackman's assistant, Stan. The Godfather's director, Francis Ford Coppola, also directed the movie.Cazale's fourth feature film, Um Dia de C\u00e3o (1975), earned him a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Sal, a bank robber.

He was in a relationship with his co-star, Meryl Streep, whilst filming O Franco Atirador (1978), whom he met when they both appeared in the New York Public Theater's 1976 production of Shakespeare's Measure for Measure.Controversy occurred during the filming. While the studio was unaware of his condition, the director, Michael Cimino, knew about it. As Cazale was evidently weak, he was forced to film his scenes first. When the studio discovered he was suffering from cancer, they wanted him removed from the film. His co-star and girlfriend, Meryl Streep, threatened to quit if he was fired.

With his mind consequently bent, Sasso decided at an early age to become an actor. At the age of fifteen, he landed his first agent and quickly began booking roles in television and film. Before moving from Vancouver to Los Angeles, Sasso starred for five seasons as the quirky teen, \"Derek Wakaluk\" on the award-winning Canadian dramatic series Madison (1993) allowing him to hone his acting and improvisational skills as well as providing him with enough money to buy a television of his own.Will starred for five seasons on FOX's hit sketch comedy series MADtv (1995) giving TV viewers a reason to stay up late with characters like the accident-prone handyman \"Paul Timberman\" and offbeat impressions of Bill Clinton, Kenny Rogers, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Steven Seagal and Randy Newman.

Her signature character type, variations on a daughter devoted to her parents and home, inspired the nickname that stayed with her until retirement: the Eternal Virgin. To some extent, reality mirrored her roles in these films. In a society that considers marriage and parenting almost obligatory, she remained single and childless, something of a controversy in Japan in the 1950s. Fortunately she was popular enough to avoid criticism, but the 1950s were still a hard decade. She was plagued by ill health, missing out on several top roles as a result, and she witnessed the death of her camera-man brother in a freak train accident on set.In 1963, shortly after the death of her mentor, director Yasujir\u00f4 Ozu, she suddenly walked away from the film industry. At age 43, and at the height of her popularity, she bluntly refused to perform again, angering her fans, the industry, and the press. She implied acting had never been a pleasure and that she had only pursued a career in order to provide for her large family; this explanation is seen as the cause of her popularity backlash. She moved to a small house in picturesque Kamakura where she remained, living alone (though apparently sociable with friends), and refusing all roles offered.She is undoubtedly known mostly for her work with Yasujiro Ozu, making six films with the great director, including the so-called Noriko trilogy, of which Era uma Vez em T\u00f3quio (1953) is probably the best-known.

Ozu made thirty-five silent films, and a trilogy of youth comedies with serious overtones he turned out in the late 1920s and early 1930s placed him in the front ranks of Japanese directors. He made his first sound film in 1936, Filho \u00danico (1936), but was drafted into the Japanese Army the next year, being posted to China for two years and then to Singapore when World War II started. Shortly before the war ended he was captured by British forces and spent six months in a P.O.W. facility. At war's end he went back to Shochiku, and his experiences during the war resulted in his making more serious, thoughtful films at a much slower pace than he had previously. His most famous film, Era uma Vez em T\u00f3quio (1953), is generally considered by critics and film buffs alike to be his \"masterpiece\" and is regarded by many as not only one of Ozu's best films but one of the best films ever made. He also turned out such classics of Japanese film as O Sabor do Ch\u00e1 Verde Sobre o Arroz (1952), Ervas Flutuantes (1959) and A Rotina Tem Seu Encanto (1962).Ozu, who never married and lived with his mother all his life, died of cancer in 1963, two years after she passed.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            frankfob2@yahoo.com\n          \n\n", "realName": null, "height": "169"},

Kajdanovsky left Junior High School to enroll in technical college where he was training to become a welder. Apparently a prospect of becoming a worker did not appeal to him and in 1965 he started studying acting at The Shchukhin Theatre School in Moscow. Before completing the course he took his first part in the film Tainstvennaya stena (1967) (A Mysterious Wall), and upon graduation in 1969, he worked as stage actor. Still unsatisfied with his work Kajdanovsky joined the army in 1973 spending some years in cavalry.It was a famous film director Nikita Mikhalkov who discovered Kajdanovsky and gave him the lead in his civil war drama Svoy sredi chuzhikh, chuzhoy sredi svoikh (1974) (At Home among Strangers, Stranger at Home). By the late 1970s Kajdanovsky had had credits in some noted films, including adventure stories Propavshaya ekspeditsiya (1975) (The Lost Expedition), Zolotaya rechka (1977) (Golden River), a fantasy Test pilota Pirxa (1979) (Pilot Pirks Tested). The greatest twist in his career came with Andrei Tarkovsky giving him the lead in Stalker (1979). Kajdanovsky attended Tarkovsky's writing seminar and under his teacher's influence he wrote and directed Prostaya smert (1985) (An Ordinary Death) - an adaptation of one of Leo Tolstoy's stories - the film won honour at the Malaga film festival. Kajdanovsky's starring role in Spanish film O Sopro do Diabo (1993) (The Devil's Breath) and in Hungarian B\u00fcv\u00f6s vad\u00e1sz (1994) (Magic Hunter) made him an international celebrity and resulted in him having been invited to become the juryman of the 1994 Cannes Film Festival. Unfortunately alcohol ruined his life, he could hardly maintain his career between the bouts of drinking, he died on December 3, 1995, 3 months short of 50.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Mike (hfhfdfse@rol.ru\n          \n\n", "realName": "Aleksandr Leonidovich Kaydanovskiy", "height": "175"},

Eisenstein, Andrei Tarkovsky (the son of noted poet Arseniy Tarkovsky) studied music and Arabic in Moscow before enrolling in the Soviet film school V.G.I.K. He shot to international attention with his first feature, A Inf\u00e2ncia de Ivan (1962), which won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival. This resulted in high expectations for his second feature _Andrei Rublyov (1969)_, which was banned by the Soviet authorities until 1971. It was shown at the 1969 Cannes Film Festival at four o'clock in the morning on the last day, in order to prevent it from winning a prize - but it won one nonetheless, and was eventually distributed abroad partly to enable the authorities to save face. Solaris (1972), had an easier ride, being acclaimed by many in Europe and North America as the Soviet answer to Kubrick's '2001' (though Tarkovsky himself was never too fond of it), but he ran into official trouble again with O Espelho (1975), a dense, personal web of autobiographical memories with a radically innovative plot structure. Stalker (1979) had to be completely reshot on a dramatically reduced budget after an accident in the laboratory destroyed the first version, and after Nostalgia (1983), shot in Italy (with official approval), Tarkovsky defected to Europe. His last film, O Sacrif\u00edcio (1986) was shot in Sweden with many of Ingmar Bergman's regular collaborators, and won an almost unprecedented four prizes at the Cannes Film Festival.

Her father was prominent playwright Romulus Linney, whose own great-grandfather was a congressman from North Carolina. Her mother, Miriam Anderson (Leggett), is a nurse. Although she did not live in her father's house (her parents having divorced when she was an infant), Linney's world revolved, in part, around his profession from the earliest age. She graduated from Brown University in 1986 and studied acting at Juilliard and the Arts Theatre School in Moscow and, thereafter, embarked on a career on the Broadway stage receiving favorable notices for her work in such plays as \"Hedda Gabler\" and \"Six Degrees of Separation\".Linney's film career began in the early 1990s with small roles in O \u00d3leo de Lorenzo (1992) and Dave, Presidente por um Dia (1993). She landed the role of Mary Anne Singleton in the PBS film adaptations of Armistead Maupin's \"Tales of the City\" series, playing her in Cr\u00f4nicas de San Francisco (1993), Mais Cr\u00f4nicas de San Francisco (1998) and Outras Cr\u00f4nicas de San Francisco (2001). Linney's first substantial big-screen role was as the ex-girlfriend of Richard Gere's character in As Duas Faces de um Crime (1996) and her superb performance brought her praise and a better selection of roles. Clint Eastwood chose Linney to play his daughter, another prominent role, in 1997's Poder Absoluto (1997), followed by another second billing in the following year's O Show de Truman: O Show da Vida (1998).Always a strong performer, Linney truly came into her own after 2000, starting the decade auspiciously with her widely-praised, arguably flawless performance in Conte Comigo (2000). She found herself nominated for an Academy Award for this, her first lead role, for which her salary had been $10,000. Linney won numerous critics' awards for her role as Sammy, a single mother whose life is complicated by a new boss and the arrival in town of her aimless brother. On the heels of this success came her marvelous turn as Bertha Dorset in A Ess\u00eancia da Paix\u00e3o (2000), clearly the best performance in a film of strong performances. Since then, Linney has frequently been offered challenging dramatic roles, and always rises to the occasion, such as in Sobre Meninos e Lobos (2003) and Kinsey: Vamos Falar de Sexo (2004), for which she received another Academy Award nomination.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Larry-115\n          \n\n", "realName": "Laura Leggett Linney", "height": "170"},

He grew up amid the happening Hollywood scene with big brother Beau Bridges. Both boys popped up, without billing, alongside their mother in the film A Carne e a Alma (1951), and appeared on occasion with their famous dad on his popular underwater TV series Aventura submarina (1958) while growing up. At age 14, Jeff toured with his father in a stage production of \"Anniversary Waltz\". The \"troublesome teen\" years proved just that for Jeff and his parents were compelled at one point to intervene when problems with drugs and marijuana got out of hand.He recovered and began shaping his nascent young adult career appearing on TV as a younger version of his father in the acclaimed TV- movie Noite de Natal (1969), and in the strange Burgess Meredith film The Yin and the Yang of Mr. Go (1978). Following fine notices for his portrayal of a white student caught up in the racially-themed Muralhas de \u00d3dio (1970), his career-maker arrived just a year later when he earned a coming-of-age role in the critically-acclaimed ensemble film A \u00daltima Sess\u00e3o de Cinema (1971). The Peter Bogdanovich- directed film made stars out off its young leads (Bridges, Timothy Bottoms, Cybill Shepherd) and Oscar winners out of its older cast (Ben Johnson, Cloris Leachman). The part of Duane Jackson, for which Jeff received his first Oscar-nomination (for \"best supporting actor\"), set the tone for the types of roles Jeff would acquaint himself with his fans -- rambling, reckless, rascally and usually unpredictable).Owning a casual carefree handsomeness and armed with a perpetual grin and sly charm, he started immediately on an intriguing 70s sojourn into offbeat filming. Chief among them were his boxer on his way up opposite a declining Stacy Keach in Cidade das Ilus\u00f5es (1972); his Civil War-era conman in the western M\u00e1 Companhia (1972); his redneck stock car racer in O Importante \u00e9 Vencer (1973); his young student anarchist opposite a stellar veteran cast in Eugene O'Neill's The Iceman Cometh (1973); his bank-robbing (also Oscar-nominated) sidekick to Clint Eastwood in O \u00daltimo Golpe (1974); his aimless cattle rustler in Amigos e Aventureiros (1975); his low-level western writer who wants to be a real-life cowboy in Do Oeste para a Fama (1975); and the brother of an assassinated President who pursues leads to the crime in Morte no Inverno (1979). All are simply marvelous characters that should have propelled him to the very top rungs of stardom...but strangely didn't.Perhaps it was his trademark ease and naturalistic approach that made him somewhat under appreciated at that time when Hollywood was run by a Dustin Hoffman, Robert De Niro and Al Pacino-like intensity. Neverthless, Jeff continued to be a scene-stealing favorite into the next decade, notably as the video game programmer in the 1982 science-fiction cult classic Tron: Uma Odisseia Eletr\u00f4nica (1982), and the struggling musician brother vying with brother Beau Bridges over the attentions of sexy singer Michelle Pfeiffer in Susie e os Baker Boys (1989). Jeff became a third-time Oscar nominee with his highly intriguing (and strangely sexy) portrayal of a blank-faced alien in O Homem das Estrelas (1984), and earned even higher regard as the ever-optimistic inventor Preston Tucker in Tucker: Um Homem e seu Sonho (1988).Since then Jeff has continued to pour on the Bridges magic on film. Few enjoy such an enduring popularity while maintaining equal respect with the critics. O Pescador de Ilus\u00f5es (1991), Nada a Perder (1992), Sem Medo de Viver (1993), O Grande Lebowski (1998) (now a cult phenomenon) and A Conspira\u00e7\u00e3o (2000) (which gave him a fourth Oscar nomination) are prime examples. More recently he seized the moment as a bald-pated villain as Robert Downey Jr.'s nemesis in Homem de Ferro (2008) and then, at age 60, he capped his rewarding career by winning the elusive Oscar, plus the Golden Globe and Screen Actor Guild awards (among many others), for his down-and-out country singer Bad Blake in Cora\u00e7\u00e3o Louco (2009). Bridges next starred in Tron: O Legado (2010), reprising one of his more famous roles, and received another Oscar nomination for Best Actor for his role in the Western remake Bravura Ind\u00f4mita (2010). In 2014, he co-produced and starred in an adaptation of the Lois Lowry science fiction drama O Doador de Mem\u00f3rias (2014).Jeff has been married since 1977 to non-professional Susan Geston (they met on the set of Amigos e Aventureiros (1975)). The couple have three daughters, Isabelle (born 1981), Jessica (born 1983), and Hayley (born 1985). He hobbies as a photographer on and off his film sets, and has been known to play around as a cartoonist and pop musician.

Her mother moved to the U.S. in 1951, from Greenock, Scotland. Her father, from Burlington, New Jersey, has German, Irish, Welsh, German-Jewish, and English ancestry.Moore spent the early years of her life in over two dozen locations around the world with her parents, during her father's military career. She finally found her place at Boston University, where she earned her Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.) degree in acting from the School of the Performing Arts. After graduation (in 1983), She took the stage name \"Julianne Moore\" because there was another actress named \"Julie Anne Smith\". Julianne moved to New York and worked extensively in theater, including appearances off-Broadway in two Caryl Churchill plays, Serious Money and Ice Cream With Hot Fudge and as Ophelia in Hamlet at The Guthrie Theatre. But despite her formal training, Julianne fell into the attractive actress' trap of the mid-1980's: TV soaps and miniseries. She appeared briefly in the daytime serial The Edge of Night (1956) and from 1985 to 1988 she played two half-sisters Frannie and Sabrina on the soap As the World Turns (1956). This performance later led to an Outstanding Ing\u00e9nue Daytime Emmy Award in 1988. Her subsequent appearances were in mostly forgettable TV-movies, such as Money, Power, Murder. (1989), The Last to Go (1991) and Feiti\u00e7o Mortal (1991).She made her entrance into the big screen with 1990's Contos da Escurid\u00e3o (1990), where she played the victim of a mummy. Two years later, Julianne appeared in feature films with supporting parts in A M\u00e3o que Balan\u00e7a o Ber\u00e7o (1992) and the comedy A Arma na Bolsa de Betty Lou (1992). She kept winning better and more powerful roles as time went on, including a small but memorable role as a doctor who spots Kimble Harrison Ford and attempts to thwart his escape in O Fugitivo (1993). (A role that made such an impression on Steven Spielberg that he cast her in the Jurassic Park: O Parque dos Dinossauros (1993) sequel without an audition in 1997). In one of Moore's most distinguished performances, she recapitulated her \"beguiling Yelena\" from Andre Gregory's workshop version of Chekhov's Uncle Vanya in Louis Malle's critically acclaimed Tio Vanya em Nova York (1994). Director Todd Haynes gave Julianne her first opportunity to take on a lead role in Mal do S\u00e9culo (1995). Her portrayal of Carol White, an affluent L.A. housewife who develops an inexplicable allergic reaction to her environment, won critical praise as well as an Independent Spirit Award nomination.Later that year she found her way into romantic comedy, co-starring as Hugh Grant's pregnant girlfriend in Nove Meses (1995). Following films included Assassinos (1995), where she played an electronics security expert targeted for death (next to Sylvester Stallone and Antonio Banderas) and Os Amores de Picasso (1996), where she played Dora Maar, one of the numerous lovers of Picasso (portrayed by her hero, Anthony Hopkins). A year later, after co-starring in Spielberg's O Mundo Perdido: Jurassic Park (1997), opposite Jeff Goldblum, a young and unknown director, Paul Thomas Anderson asked Julianne to appear in his movie, Boogie Nights: Prazer Sem Limites (1997). Despite her misgivings, she finally was won over by the script and her decision to play the role of Amber Waves, a loving porn star who acts as a mother figure to a ragtag crew, proved to be a wise one, since she received both Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations. Julianne started 1998 by playing an erotic artist in O Grande Lebowski (1998), continued with a small role in the social comedy Chicago Cab (1997) and ended with a subtle performance in Gus Van Sant's remake of Psicose (1960). 1999 had Moore as busy as an actress can be.As the century closed, Julianne starred in a number of high-profile projects, beginning with Robert Altman's A Fortuna de Cookie (1999) , in which she was cast as the mentally challenged but adorable sister of a decidedly unhinged Glenn Close. A portrayal of the scheming Mrs. Cheveley followed in Oliver Parker's O Marido Ideal (1999) with a number of critics asserting that Moore was the best part of the movie. She then enjoyed another collaboration with director Anderson in Magn\u00f3lia (1999) and continued with an outstanding performance in Fim de Caso (1999), for which she garnered another Oscar nomination. She ended 1999 with another great performance, that of a grieving mother in O Mapa do Mundo (1999), opposite Sigourney Weaver.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Catherine Grace\n          \n\n", "realName": "Julie Anne Smith", "height": "160"},

While he had supporting roles in some other major productions like Perfume de Mulher (1992) and Twister (1996), his breakthrough role came in Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights: Prazer Sem Limites (1997). He quickly became an icon of indie cinema, establishing a reputation as one of the screen's finest actors, in a variety of supporting and second leads in indie and major features, including Todd Solondz's Felicidade (1998), Ningu\u00e9m \u00e9 Perfeito (1999), O Talentoso Ripley (1999), Paul Thomas Anderson's Magn\u00f3lia (1999), Quase Famosos (2000) and Deu a Louca nos Astros (2000).

In 2006, he was awarded the Best Actor Oscar for the same role. On February 2, 2014, Philip Seymour Hoffman was found dead in an apartment in Greenwich village, New York.

However, while completing his studies, he developed an interest in theatre, to the chagrin of his father, who wanted his children to find secure positions in life.A drama teacher initially at a Catholic girls convent school, he decided to follow his acting instincts full-time and gradually built up an impressive array of classical stage credits via repertory, including the Bristol Old Vic Drama School, and in stints with Liverpool Everyman, Manchester Royal Exchange and the Royal Shakespeare Company. By the 1980s he was ready to branch out into film and TV, giving a startling performance as a wife abuser in the Vozes Distantes (1988).By 1993 he had crossed over into Hollywood parts and earned his first Oscar nomination for his superb role as Daniel Day-Lewis' father in Em Nome do Pai (1993). Other quality roles came his way with Os Suspeitos (1995), Um Toque de Esperan\u00e7a (1996), and Amistad (1997). He did fine work on television in Sharpe's Company (1994), Lost for Words (1999), and The Sins (2000).

He found a place to live in Hell's Kitchen, New York City, and was low on finances at first. He eventually made his first film, Meu P\u00e9 Esquerdo (1989), starring Daniel Day-Lewis, about the Irish artist Christy Brown, who only had control of his left foot.The film was a surprise success, with both Day-Lewis and co-star Brenda Fricker winning Oscars for their performances. Sheridan received two Oscar nominations for Best Director (he lost to Oliver Stone) and Best Screenplay. It was an amazing debut film, and at age 40, Sheridan was a late bloomer to the film industry. He followed \"My Left Foot\" with the film Terra da Disc\u00f3rdia (1990). Starring Richard Harris a then-unknown Sean Bean and John Hurt, this film was based on a theatre play by John B. Keane. It earned Harris an Oscar nomination, but was otherwise short of \"My Left Foot\"'s success.Sheridan bounced back three years later with the film Em Nome do Pai (1993), once again starring Daniel Day-Lewis. The film concerns four teenagers who are accused of an IRA bombing. Gerry (Day-Lewis) finds that his father (Pete Postlethwaite), aunt, and cousins are also accused as being accomplices. He and his father spend fifteen years in prison together until a lawyer (Emma Thompson) takes their case to court once again. The film was successful critically and commercially, gaining seven Oscar nominations (including three for Sheridan) but did not win anything.Throughout the 90s, Sheridan did some on-the-side work as an actor and as a writer, and his writing credits include the prison film M\u00e3es em Luta (1996) in which IRA prisoners went on a hunger strike to protest their treatment as criminals. Sheridan's next directorial film was the gritty film O Lutador (1997), which was also the third collaboration between Sheridan and Daniel Day-Lewis. The film was about a former IRA associate released from prison after fourteen years. He attempts to put his life back together by starting a boxing club, as well as reconciling with his former love (played by Emily Watson). It was nominated for three Golden Globes, including Best Actor (Day-Lewis) and Best Director (Sheridan).Sheridan moved slowly between his films; his next film was very personal to his own experiences: the dramatic film Terra de Sonhos (2002), starring Paddy Considine, and Samantha Morton. The story is about an Irish family that immigrates illegally to the United States. The father is an actor, attempting to find success, so that he can look after his children. The film received many positive reviews, and earned Sheridan a final Oscar nomination for Best Screenplay.Sheridan's next film no doubt surprised many people: the rap film Fique Rico ou Morra Tentando (2005) starring famous (or infamous) rapper 50 Cent and Terence Howard. The film was about a drug dealer that pursues his rap dream. The film was hit with many criticisms, but some, like renowned critic Roger Ebert, saw that there was a lot of emotion in the film, as well as showing the consequences of the gangster life.Sheridan also finished a film Entre Irm\u00e3os (2009) based on a Danish movie by Susanne Bier. The film stars well known and talented actors Jake Gyllenhaal, Natalie Portman and Tobey Maguire, and tells the story of a man whose brother is missing in Afghanistan, leaving him to look after his brother's family. The film was released late 2009 and was a modest success. Tobey Maguire received a Golden Globe nomination, as did a song written for the movie by U2.Sheridan is now busy filming A Casa dos Sonhos (2011) set to be a thriller involving paranormal activities surrounding a family moving into a new home.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Bob Stage\n          \n\n", "realName": null, "height": "170"},

In July 1997, Harris accepted the role of Mark Cohen for the Los Angeles production of the beloved musical, Rent: Os Bo\u00eamios (2005). His performance in \"Rent\" garnered him a Drama-League Award in 1997. He continued in the musical, to rave reviews, until January 1998. He later reprised the role for six nights in his hometown of Albuquerque, New Mexico, in December 1998.In 1999, Harris returned to television in the short-lived sitcom Stark Raving Mad (1999), with Tony Shalhoub. He was also in the big-screen projects Sobrou pra Voc\u00ea (2000) and Com a Cor e a Coragem (2002), and he can be heard as the voice of Peter Parker/Spider-Man in the newest animated Homem-Aranha - A Nova S\u00e9rie Animada (2003) series. Harris has continued his stage work, making his Broadway debut in 2001 in \"Proof.\" He has also appeared on stage in \"Romeo and Juliet,\" \"Cabaret,\" Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street in Concert (2001), and, most recently, \"Assassins.\" In 2005, Harris returned to the small screen in a guest-starring role on Numb3rs (2005) and a starring role in the sitcom Como Eu Conheci Sua M\u00e3e (2005). Neil played the title role in the web-exclusive musical comedy Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog (2008), widely downloaded via iTunes to become the #1 TV series for five straight weeks, despite not actually being on television.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            ChristiRene80@aol.com\n          \n\n", "realName": null, "height": "183"},

His parents, Jeanne (Martyn) and Ronald Worthington, a power plant employee, moved the family to Australia when he was six months old, and raised him and his sister Lucinda in Warnbro, a suburb of Perth, Western Australia.Worthington graduated from NIDA (Australia's National Institute of Dramatic Art) in 1998 at the age of 22. He received critical acclaim for his portrayal of \"Arthur Wellesley\" in his first professional role in the Belvoir Street Theatre production \"Judas Kiss\" (directed by Neil Armfield). He then went on to work in Australian television on such shows as Water Rats (1996) and \"Backburner\" and then on the American TV show JAG: Ases Invenc\u00edveis (1995)'s 100th episode (Boomerang: Part 1).Worthington made his film debut in the highly acclaimed Australian movie Dan\u00e7a, Paix\u00e3o e Fama (2000), a film about a troop of \"tap dogs\". Minor roles proceeded in A Guerra de Hart (2002) and A Matter of Life (2001) before he was cast in another hailed Australian drama, Jogo Sujo (2002), co-starring Toni Collette and John Goodman.The following year, he starred in yet another Aussie film, opposite David Wenham in Entrando na Linha (2003). The director of the film, Jonathan Teplitzky, originally tested actors who were up to 8 years older than the then-27-year-old Worthington. Teplitzky wasn't sure Sam \"could convincingly play a tough guy and also have elements of the leading man about him\", but in the end Teplitzky decided he was \"fantastic\", and had \"David playing the older, slightly more streetwise accomplice\" proclaiming \"it worked\".But it wasn't until 2004 that Sam got his big break. He was offered the starring role in Cate Shortland's acclaimed Australian drama Salto Mortal (2004), opposite Abbie Cornish. The film made a clean sweep of the Australian Film Institute awards in 2004, winning in 13 film categories - the first time this has ever occurred in the award's history. Worthington also won the AFI award for Best Male Actor.Worthington's career took off internationally when he was cast as Jake Sully in James Cameron's Avatar (2009) and as Marcus Wright, a cyborg who assists the humans despite their suspicions of him in O Exterminador do Futuro: A Salva\u00e7\u00e3o (2009).

She was born in Adelaide, South Australia, to Kevin Palmer, an investor, and Paula Sanders, a former missionary and nurse. She completed high school at Mercedes College in 2003, where she was a popular student who was well-known for her practical jokes. She worked in a Cotton On outlet in Rundle Mall until she was discovered and cast on the spot--without an audition--in her feature film debut and breakthrough role in 2:37 - \u00c9 S\u00f3 Uma Quest\u00e3o de Tempo (2006). Made by first-time writer/director/producer Murali K. Thalluri, the film competed in the 2006 Cannes Film Festival in \"Un Certain Regard\" and chronicles the lives of six students over the course of day and ends in a devastating suicide.Teresa immediately went to work on back-to-back film projects including Um Ver\u00e3o para Toda Vida (2007) opposite \"Harry Potter\" star Daniel Radcliffe--a coming-of-age story about four adolescent orphans, based on the book by Michael Noonan and directed by Rod Hardy (Robinson Cruso\u00e9 (1997), Buffalo Girls - As \u00daltimas Pistoleiras (1995), Arquivo X (1993) and O Desafio (1997)). She also starred as stripper-turned-criminal \"Dale\" in the British/Australian co-production Aprisionados (2008), a film noir/psychological thriller that follows the plight of a pair of fugitives on the run from a murder scene. Directed by David Denneen, the film also features former Calvin Klein model Travis Fimmel and British actor Stephen Moyer. In 2006 Teresa worked with Japanese director Takashi Shimizu on the Sony Pictures production O Grito 2 (2006). Set in Tokyo, the horror sequel to the box-office hit O Grito (2004) also starred Sarah Michelle Gellar and Jennifer Beals. Later that year Teresa signed on to play the female lead in Doug Liman's action fantasy film Jumper (2008), but was subsequently replaced by Rachel Bilson.Early 2007 saw her star opposite former real-life boyfriend Topher Grace as the love interest in the retro comedy film Uma Noite Mais Que Louca (2011). Shortly after filming ended, Teresa decided to move permanently from Adelaide to Los Angeles following a public split from her then-boyfriend of two years, Australian Rules football star Stuart Dew. Teresa was due to play a small part in George Miller's doomed superhero film \"Justice League: Mortal\", but the production fell through after months of problems. Teresa briefly dated her \"Justice League: Mortal\" co-star Adam Brody in early 2008; later that year she had a relationship with British comedian Russell Brand, whom she met on the set of her latest film, Um Faz de Conta Que Acontece (2008), a Disney children's comedy starring Lucy Lawless, Guy Pearce and Keri Russell and was released on Christmas 2008.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Shanahan (qv's & corrections by A.

That asset? It was, of course, her squeaky, frog-like voice, which silent-era cinema audiences had simply no way of perceiving, much less appreciating. Jean Arthur, born Gladys Georgianna Greene in upstate New York, 20 miles south of the Canadian border, has had her year of birth cited variously as 1900, 1905 and 1908. Her place of birth has often been cited as New York City! (Herein we shall rely for those particulars on Miss Arthur's obituary as given in the authoritative and reliable New York Times. The date and place indicated above shall be deemed correct.) Following her screen debut in a bit part in John Ford's Sota, Cavalo e Rei (1923), she spent several years playing unremarkable roles as ing\u00e9nue or leading lady in comedy shorts and cheapie westerns. With the arrival of sound she was able to appear in films whose quality was but slightly improved over that of her past silents. She had to contend, for example, with the consummately evil likes of Dr. Fu Manchu (played by future \"Charlie Chan\" Warner Oland). Her career bloomed with her appearance in Ford's O Homem que Nunca Pecou (1935), in which she played opposite Edward G. Robinson, the latter in a dual role as a notorious gangster and his lookalike, a befuddled, well-meaning clerk. Here is where her wholesomeness and flair for farcical comedy began making themselves plain. The turning point in her career came when she was chosen by Frank Capra to star with Gary Cooper in the classic social comedy O Galante Mr. Deeds (1936). Here she rescues the hero - thus herself becoming heroine! - from rapacious human vultures who are scheming to separate him from his wealth. In Capra's masterpiece A Mulher Faz o Homem (1939), she again rescues a besieged hero (James Stewart), protecting him from a band of manipulative and cynical politicians and their cronies and again she ends up as a heroine of sorts. For her performance in George Stevens' Original Pecado (1943), in which she starred with Joel McCrea and Charles Coburn, she received a Best Actress Academy Award nomination, but the award went to Jennifer Jones in A Can\u00e7\u00e3o de Bernadette (1943) (Coburn, incidentally, won for Best Supporting Actor). Her career began waning toward the end of the 1940s. She starred with Marlene Dietrich and John Lund in Billy Wilder's fluff about post-World War II Berlin, A Mundana (1948). Thereafter, the actress would return to the screen but once, again for George Stevens but not in comedy. She starred with Alan Ladd and Van Heflin in Stevens' western Os Brutos Tamb\u00e9m Amam (1953), playing the wife of a besieged settler (Heflin) who accepts help from a nomadic gunman (Ladd) in the settler's effort to protect his farm. It was her silver-screen swansong. She would provide one more opportunity for a mass audience to appreciate her craft. In 1966 she starred as a witty and sophisticated lawyer, Patricia Marshall, a widow, in the TV series The Jean Arthur Show (1966). Her time was apparently past, however; the show ran for only 11 weeks.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Bill Takacs\n          \n\n", "realName": "Gladys Georgianna Greene", "height": "160"},

His family is of Irish origin. Gerard spent some of his very early childhood in Montreal, Quebec, but was mostly raised, along with his older brother and sister, in his hometown of Paisley. His parents divorced when he was a child, and he and his siblings were raised primarily by their mother, who later remarried. He had no contact with his father between the ages of two and 16 years old, after which time they became close. His father passed away when Gerard was in his early 20s. Butler went on to attend Glasgow University, where he studied to be a lawyer/solicitor. He was president of the school's law society thanks to his outgoing personality and great social skills.His acting career began when he was approached in a London coffee shop by actor Steven Berkoff, who later appeared alongside Butler in \u00c1tila, o Huno (2001), who gave him a role in a stage production of \"Coriolanus\" (later, Butler played Tullus Aufidius in a big screen Coriolano (2011). After that, Butler decided to give up law for acting. He was cast as Ewan McGregor's character \"Renton\" in the stage adaptation of Trainspotting. His film debut was as Billy Connolly's younger brother in Sua Majestade, Mrs. Brown (1997). While filming the movie in Scotland, he was enjoying a picnic with his mother near the River Tay when they heard the shouts of a young boy, who had been swimming with a friend, who was in some trouble. Butler jumped in and saved the young boy from drowning. He received a Certificate of Bravery from the Royal Humane Society. He felt he only did what anyone in the situation would have done.His film career continued with small roles, first in the \"James Bond\" movie, 007 - O Amanh\u00e3 Nunca Morre (1997), and then Russell Mulcahy's O Enigma de Talos (1998). In 2000, Butler was cast in two breakthrough roles, the first being \"Attila the Hun\" in the USA Network mini-series, \u00c1tila, o Huno (2001). The film's producers wanted a known actor to play the part but kept coming back to Butler's screen tests and decided he was their man. He had to lose the thick Scottish accent, but managed well. Around the time \"Attila\" was being filmed, casting was in progress for Wes Craven's new take on the \"Dracula\" legacy. Also wanting a known name, Butler wasn't much of a consideration, but his unending tenacity drove him to hounding the producers. Eventually, he sent them a clip of his portrayal of \"Attila\". Evidently, they saw something because Dr\u00e1cula 2000 (2000) was cast in the form of Butler. Attila's producers, thinking that his big-screen role might help with their own film's ratings, finished shooting a little early so he could get to work on Dr\u00e1cula 2000 (2000). Following these two roles, Butler developed quite a fan base, and began appearing on websites and fancasts everywhere.Since then, he has appeared in Reino de Fogo (2002) as \"Creedy\" and Lara Croft: Tomb Raider - A Origem da Vida (2003) as \"Terry Sheridan\", alongside Angelina Jolie. The role that garnered him the most attention from both moviegoers and movie makers, alike, was that of \"Andre Marek\" in the big-screen adaptation of Michael Crichton's novel, Linha do Tempo (2003). Butler played an archaeologist who was sent back in time with a team of students to rescue a colleague. Last year, he appeared in Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical, O Fantasma da \u00d3pera (2004), playing the title character in the successful adaptation of the stage musical. It was a role that brought him much international attention.

While working as an assistant animator and layout artist for Hinton Animation Studios in Ottawa, Ontario, DeBlois simultaneously attended Sheridan College's three year Classical Animation program. Upon graduation in 1990, DeBlois was immediately hired by Don Bluth Studios in Dublin, Ireland. There, he cut his teeth as a layout artist, character designer, and storyboard assistant to Don Bluth on such films as A Polegarzinha (1994) and Um Duende no Parque (1994).\" In 1994, DeBlois left Ireland to work for Walt Disney Feature Animation as a storyboard artist, where he soon replaced his frequent collaborator, Chris Sanders, as Head of Story on Mulan (1998).\" Shortly thereafter, they re-re-teamed to create the lush and whimsical Lilo & Stitch (2002), heralded by critics as Disney's last great hand-drawn film. Following its release in 2002, DeBlois sold several original live action feature projects to write, direct, and produce, including \"The Banshee and Finn Magee,\" \"The Lighthouse,\" and \"Sightings,\" set-up at Walt Disney Pictures, Touchstone, and Universal Studios respectively. At present, all three remain in development. 2007 unveiled DeBlois' first foray into documentary filmmaking, with the acclaimed feature length music film, Sigur R\u00f3s - Em Casa (2007), chronicling the homecoming concert odyssey of Iceland's famed post-rock phenomenon, Sigur R\u00f3s.

The two re-envisioned the story from scratch, leading the production to its March 26, 2010 release, at break-neck speed. The resulting film earned Dreamworks Animation its highest critical acclaim to date and became the studio's top grossing film outside of the \"Shrek\" franchise. During this same time, DeBlois also directed another feature-length music film for Sigur R\u00f3s front-man J\u00f3nsi, entitled Go Quiet (2010), as well as a feature length concert film entitled \"J\u00f3nsi: Live at The Wiltern.\" At present, DeBlois is writing, directing, and executive producing the highly anticipated sequel to Como Treinar o Seu Drag\u00e3o (2010), \"which he describes as \"the epic second act of a much larger story\".\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            anonymous\n          \n\n", "realName": null, "height": "188"},

Joe and Myra were Vaudevillian comedians with a popular, ever-changing variety act, giving Keaton an eclectic and interesting upbringing. In the earliest days on stage, they traveled with a medicine show that included family friend, illusionist Harry Houdini. Keaton himself verified the origin of his nickname \"Buster\", given to him by Houdini, when at the age of three, fell down a flight of stairs and was picked up and dusted off by Houdini, who said to Keaton's father Joe, also nearby, that the fall was 'a buster'. Savvy showman Joe Keaton liked the nickname, which has stuck for more than 100 years.At the age of four, Keaton had already begun acting with his parents on the stage. Their act soon gained the reputation as one of the roughest in the country, for their wild, physical antics on stage. It was normal for Joe to throw Buster around the stage, participate in elaborate, dangerous stunts to the reverie of audiences. After several years on the Vaudeville circuit, \"The Three Keatons\", toured until Keaton had to break up the act due to his father's increasing alcohol dependence, making him a show business veteran by the age of 21.While in New York looking for work, a chance run-in with the wildly successful film star and director Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle, resulted in Arbuckle inviting him to be in his upcoming short O Garoto A\u00e7ougueiro (1917), an appearance that launched Keaton's film career, and spawned a friendship that lasted until Arbuckle's sudden death in 1933. By 1920, after making several successful shorts together, Arbuckle moved on to features, and Keaton inherited his studio, allowing him the opportunity to begin producing his own films. By September 1921, tragedy touched Arbuckle's life by way of a scandal, where he was tried three times for the murder of Virginia Rapp. Although he was not guilty of the charges, and never convicted, he was unable to regain his status, and the viewing public would no longer tolerate his presence in film. Keaton stood by his friend and mentor through out the incident, supporting him financially, finding him directorial work, even risking his own budding reputation offering to testify on Arbuckle's behalf.In 1921, Keaton also married his first wife, Natalie Talmadge under unusual circumstance that have never been fully clarified. Popular conjecture states that he was encouraged by Joseph M. Schenck to marry into the powerful Talmadge dynasty, that he himself was already a part of. The union bore Keaton two sons. Keaton's independent shorts soon became too limiting for the growing star, and after a string of popular films like Uma Semana (1920), The Boat (1921) and O Enrascado (1922), Keaton made the transition into feature films. His first feature, As Tr\u00eas Idades (1923), was produced similarly to his short films, and was the dawning of a new era in comedic cinema, where it became apparent to Keaton that he had to put more focus on the story lines and characterization.At the height of his popularity, he was making two features a year, and followed Ages with Nossa Hospitalidade (1923), O Navegador (1924) and A General (1926), the latter two he regarded as his best films. The most renowned of Keaton's comedies is Bancando o \u00c1guia (1924), which used cutting edge special effects that received mixed reviews as critics and audiences alike had never seen anything like it, and did not know what to make of it. Modern day film scholars liken the story and effects to Christopher Nolan A Origem (2010), for its high level concept and ground-breaking execution. Keaton's Civil War epic The General (1926) kept up his momentum when he gave audiences the biggest and most expensive sequence ever seen in film at the time. At its climax, a bridge collapses while a train is passing over it, sending the train into a river. This wowed audiences, but did little for its long-term financial success. Audiences did not respond well to the film, disliking the higher level of drama over comedy, and the main character being a Confederate soldier.After a few more silent features, including Amores de um Estudante (1927) and Marinheiro de Encomenda (1928), Keaton was informed that his contract had been sold to MGM, by brother-in-law and producer Joseph M. Schenck. Keaton regarded the incident as the worst professional mistake he ever made, as it sent his career, legacy, and personal life into a vicious downward spiral for many years. His first film with MGM was O Homem das Novidades (1928), which is regarded as one of his best silent comedies, but the release signified the loss of control Keaton would incur, never again regaining his film -making independence. He made one more silent film at MGM entitled O Noivo Cara-Dura (1929) before the sound era arrived.His first appearance in a film with sound was with the ensemble piece Hollywood Revue (1929), though despite the popularity of it and his previous MGM silents, MGM never allowed Keaton his own production unit, and increasingly reduced his creative control over his films. By 1932, his marriage to Natalie Talmadge had dissolved when she sued him for divorce, and in an effort to placate her, put up little resistance. This resulted in the loss of the home he had built for his family nicknamed \"The Italian Villa\", the bulk of his assets, and contact with his children. Natalie changed their last names from Keaton to Talmadge, and they were disallowed from speaking about their father or seeing him. About 10 years later, when they became of age, they rekindled the relationship with Keaton. His hardships in his professional and private life that had been slowly taking their toll, begun to culminate by the early 1930s resulting in his own dependence on alcohol, and sometimes violent and erratic behavior. Depressed, penniless, and out of control, he was fired by MGM by 1933, and became a full-fledged alcoholic.After spending time in hospitals to attempt and treat his alcoholism, he met second wife Mae Scrivens, a nurse, and married her hastily in Mexico, only to end in divorce by 1935. After his firing, he made several low-budget shorts for Educational Pictures, and spent the next several years of his life fading out of public favor, and finding work where he could. His career was slightly reinvigorated when he produced the short Grand Slam Opera (1936), which many of his fans admire for giving such a good performance during the most difficult and unmanageable years of his life.In 1940, he met and married his third wife Eleanor Norris, who was deeply devoted to him, and remained his constant companion and partner until Keaton's death. After several more years of hardship working as an uncredited, underpaid gag man for comedians such as the Marx Brothers, he was consulted on how to do a realistic and comedic fall for A Noiva Desconhecida (1949) in which an expensive violin is destroyed. Finding no one who could do this better than him, he was given a minor role in the film. His presence reignited interest in his silent films, which lead to interviews, television appearances, film roles, and world tours that kept him busy for the rest of his life.After several more film, television, and stage appearances through the 1960s, he wrote the autobiography \"My Wonderful World of Slapstick\", having completed nearly 150 films in the span of his ground-breaking career. His last film appearance was Um Escravo das Ar\u00e1bias em Roma (1966) which premiered seven months after Keaton's death from the rapid onset of lung cancer. Since his death, Keaton's legacy is being discovered by new generations of viewers every day, many of his films are available on YouTube, DVD and Blu-ray, where he, like all gold-gilded and beloved entertainers can live forever.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Ed Stephan <stephan@cc.wwu.edu>\n          \n\n", "realName": "Joseph Frank Keaton", "height": "165"},

Born Joey Marion McReery, she began her career as a Mack Sennet Bathing Girl. She soon progressed to become a popular figure in two-reelers and serials. On one of these, 'Mary of the Movies' (1923) she featured - uncredited - as screenwriter as well as star, something she was to do many times. She did not earn her first credit until 1938 - `and only because I insisted'. She married the movie's producer, Lewis Lewyn, in 1924. She heard of the part in `The General' through her hairdresser. The resulting six month shoot was arduous, and Marion decided afterwards that she would rather quit acting than endure such a long separation from her husband again. Her last starring appearance was in `Alice in Movieland' (1927). From then on, her work was mainly done behind the camera. She and her husband produced a number of successful series of shorts, including as `Voice of Hollywood' and `Hollywood on Parade'. Soon after Lewis' death in 1969, interest in `The General' was revived and Marion toured extensively with the movie, giving interviews and lectures about working with the comic legend Buster Keaton.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Camille Scaysbrook {verona_beach@hotpop.com}\n          \n\n", "realName": "Joey Marion McCreery", "height": "160"},

He got the role (along with River Phoenix) but although the movie was favourably reviewed, it met with little commercial success which discouraged Hawke from pursuing further movie roles for several years.He was admitted to the prestigious Carnegie-Mellon University to study theatre but his studies were interrupted when he won his break-through role opposite Robin Williams in Sociedade dos Poetas Mortos (1989) and he did not complete his degree.

He starred in the romantic drama Antes do Amanhecer (1995), and its later sequels Antes do P\u00f4r-do-Sol (2004) and Antes da Meia-Noite (2013).His subsequent acting career was a mix of theatre work (earning a number of awards and nominations, including a Tony Award nomination for his role in \"The Coast of Utopia\" at the Lincoln Center in New York), and a mix of serious and more commercial movies, notably Gattaca, uma Experi\u00eancia Gen\u00e9tica (1997) (where he met his first wife, Uma Thurman) and Dia de Treinamento (2001). His role as the father in the coming-of-age drama Boyhood: Da Inf\u00e2ncia \u00e0 Juventude (2014) earned him multiple award nominations, including the Academy, BAFTA, Golden Globe, and SAG Award for Best Supporting Actor.Meanwhile, he also wrote two novels: \"The Hottest State\" (1996) and \"Ash Wednesday\" (2002).\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Pedro Borges\n          \n\n", "realName": "Ethan Green Hawke", "height": "179"},

Linklater III. Richard was among the first and most successful talents to emerge during the American independent film renaissance of the 1990s. Typically setting each of his movies during one 24-hour period, Linklater's work explored what he dubbed \"the youth rebellion continuum,\" focusing in fine detail on generational rites and mores with rare compassion and understanding while definitively capturing the 20-something culture of his era through a series of nuanced, illuminating ensemble pieces which introduced any number of talented young actors into the Hollywood firmament. Born in Houston, Texas, Linklater suspended his educational career at Sam Houston State University in 1982, to work on an offshore oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico. He subsequently relocated to the state's capital of Austin, where he founded a film society and began work on his debut film, 1987's It's Impossible to Learn to Plow by Reading Books (1988). Three years later he released the sprawling Slacker (1990), an insightful, virtually plotless look at 1990s youth culture that became a favorite on the festival circuit prior to earning vast acclaim at Sundance in 1991. Upon its commercial release, the movie, made for less than $23,000, became the subject of considerable mainstream media attention, with the term \"slacker\" becoming a much-overused catch-all tag employed to affix a name and identity to America's disaffected youth culture.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            goodtanin@yahoo.com\n          \n\n", "realName": "Richard Stuart Linklater", "height": "175"},

(Kieselbach), a ballet dancer, and George Harris Kennedy, an orchestra leader and musician. Following high school graduation, Kennedy enlisted in the United States Army in 1943 with the hope to become a fighter pilot in the Army Air Corps. Instead, he wound up in the infantry, served under General George S. Patton and distinguished himself with valor. He won two Bronze Stars and four rows of combat and service ribbons.A World War II veteran, Kennedy at one stage in his career cornered the market at playing tough, no-nonsense characters who were either quite crooked or possessed hearts of gold. Kennedy notched up an impressive 200+ appearances in both television and films, and was well respected within the Hollywood community. He started out on television Westerns in the late 1950s and early 1960s (Paladino do Oeste (1957), Rawhide (1959), Maverick (1957), Colt .45 (1957), among others) before scoring minor roles in films including Sua \u00daltima Fa\u00e7anha (1962), Os Filhos de Katie Elder (1965) and O Voo da F\u00eanix (1965).The late 1960s was a very busy period for Kennedy, and he was strongly in favor with casting agents, appearing in O Incerto Amanh\u00e3 (1967), Os Doze Condenados (1967) and scoring an Oscar win as Best Supporting Actor for his performance in Rebeldia Indom\u00e1vel (1967). The disaster film boom of the 1970s was also kind to Kennedy and his talents were in demand for Aeroporto (1970) and the three subsequent sequels, as a grizzled police officer in Terremoto (1974), plus the buddy/road film O \u00daltimo Golpe (1974) as vicious bank robber Red Leary.The 1980s saw Kennedy appear in a mishmash of roles, playing various characters; however, Kennedy and Leslie Nielsen surprised everyone with their comedic talents in the hugely successful Corra que a Pol\u00edcia vem A\u00ed! (1988), and the two screen veterans exaggerate themselves again, in Corra que a Pol\u00edcia vem A\u00ed! 2 1/2 (1991) and Corra que a Pol\u00edcia vem A\u00ed! 33 1/3: O Insulto Final (1994). From 1988-1991, he also played Ewing family nemesis Carter McKay on the CBS prime-time soap opera Dallas (1978).Kennedy also played President Warren G. Harding in the miniseries Backstairs at the White House (1979) and had a long standing role on the CBS daytime soap opera The Young and the Restless (1973). He remained busy in Hollywood and lent his distinctive voice to the animated Gatos N\u00e3o Sabem Dan\u00e7ar (1997) and the children's action film Pequenos Guerreiros (1998). A Hollywood stalwart for nearly 50 years, he is one of the most enjoyable actors to watch on screen. His last role was in the film O Apostador (2014), as Mark Wahlberg's character's grandfather.George Kennedy died of natural causes in Middleton, Idaho on February 28, 2016, only ten days after his 91st birthday.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            firehouse44\n          \n\n", "realName": "George Harris Kennedy Jr.", "height": "193"},

His subsequent studies at the Academy of Dramatic Arts were interrupted as a result of wartime military service from 1942 to 1945. After the war, Cannon returned to New York to complete his training and acting on the stage, both on and off-Broadway, trying his hand at a wide variety of parts, mostly in classical plays. He essayed \"Petruchio\" in \"The Taming of the Shrew\" and appeared on Broadway in \"Henry IV\", \"Lysistrata\" and \"Peer Gynt\". Leading roles were few and far between, however.Once Cannon had found his niche as a frequent guest star on numerous television episodes, his career as a motion picture actor became somewhat desultory, though he had memorable roles in two films: as the road gang convict \"Society Red\" in Rebeldia Indom\u00e1vel (1967); and as the gangster \"Calhoun\" in Rififi no Harlem (1970). His first TV appearance was as a poker-hustling master sergeant in a 1958 episode of The Phil Silvers Show (1955). His tough screen persona was pretty well established by the mid-60's, though, against character, he portrayed the timid weakling \"Lloyd Chandler\" (witness to the original crime committed by the \"one-armed man\") in the final denouement installment of O Fugitivo (1963). He was at his scene-stealing best in an episode of Os Invasores (1967) as \"Peter Kalter\", a strangely sympathetic mobster who turns against his own outfit and aids the chief protagonist against the impending alien threat.In his recurring role as lawman \"Harry Briscoe\" in the western comedy series Smith & Jones (1971), Cannon was again given the opportunity to deliver some enjoyably caustic one-liners, something at which he excelled. He will arguably be most fondly remembered for his popular portrayal of the perpetually exasperated, choleric, cigar-chewing NYPD Chief of Detectives, \"Peter B.

Her mother, Beverly (Bushfield), was a homemaker, and her father, Thad Harold Harden, was in the military. The family relocated often -- she first became interested in the theatre when the family was living in Greece, and she had attended plays in Athens. Harden began her college education at American universities in Europe and returned to the US to complete her studies at the University of Texas in 1983; went on to earn an MFA at NYU, and, thereafter, embarked on her acting career.Although she had acted in a movie as early as 1986, in the little-known Pr\u00f3xima Atra\u00e7\u00e3o: Morte (1986), her first mainstream role, coming alongside some TV movie work, was as a sultry femme fatale in the Coen Brothers' cleverly offbeat homage to the gangster movie, Ajuste Final (1990). Harden received good reviews for her sultry performance as Verna, a seductive, trouble-making moll. Harden thereafter worked steadily in supporting roles, including the portrayal of Ava Gardner in Sinatra - A M\u00fasica Era Apenas o Come\u00e7o (1992), a television biopic about Frank Sinatra. Harden also worked in the theater and, in 1993, was part of the Broadway cast of Tony Kushner's \"Angels in America\", playing Harper, the alienated wife of a closeted gay man. It was a demanding dramatic role, and Harden won acclaim for her work, including a Tony award nomination. She returned to movie making in the mid-1990s, continuing to turn in superb supporting performances in films and television.Harden's road to success was a long one, her work generally being overlooked because the productions were either critically panned or ignored by audiences. However, it was just a matter of time before Harden got a chance to truly show her quality on-screen, and that time came in 2000, with Ed Harris's Pollock (2000), in which she played Lee Krasner, artist and long-suffering wife of Jackson Pollock. Harden's performance was deeply moving and unforgettable and earned her the Oscar and New York Film Critic's Circle awards for best supporting actress. Continuing to work prolifically in features and television, she earned another Oscar nomination in 2003 for her supporting role in Clint Eastwood's Sobre Meninos e Lobos (2003), Harden having earlier worked with Eastwood in 2000's Cowboys do Espa\u00e7o (2000).Harden's work often makes otherwise mediocre productions worth watching, fully inhabiting any character she portrays. She was married to Thaddaeus Scheel, with whom she worked on The Spitfire Grill - O Recome\u00e7o (1996), from 1996 to 2012.

His brother was actor Chris Penn. His father was from a Lithuanian Jewish/Russian Jewish family, and his mother is of half Italian and half Irish descent.Penn first appeared in roles as strong-headed or unruly youths such as the military cadet defending his academy against closure in Toque de Recolher (1981), then as fast-talking surfer stoner Jeff Spicoli in Picardias Estudantis (1982).Fans and critics were enthused about his obvious talent and he next contributed a stellar performance alongside Timothy Hutton in the Cold War spy thriller A Trai\u00e7\u00e3o do Falc\u00e3o (1985), followed by a teaming with icy Christopher Walken in the chilling Caminhos Violentos (1986). The youthful Sean then paired up with his then wife, pop diva Madonna in the woeful, and painful, Surpresa em Shanghai (1986), which was savaged by the critics, but Sean bounced back with a great job as a hot-headed young cop in As Cores da Viol\u00eancia (1988), gave another searing performance as a US soldier in Vietnam committing atrocities in Pecados de Guerra (1989) and appeared alongside Robert De Niro in the uneven comedy N\u00e3o Somos Anjos (1989). However, the 1990s was the decade in which Sean really got noticed by critics as a mature, versatile and accomplished actor, with a string of dynamic performances in first-class films.Almost unrecognisable with frizzy hair and thin rimmed glasses, Penn was simply brilliant as corrupt lawyer David Kleinfeld in the Brian De Palma gangster movie O Pagamento Final (1993) and he was still in trouble with authority as a Death Row inmate pleading with a caring nun to save his life in Os \u00daltimos Passos de um Homem (1995), for which he received his first Oscar nomination. Sean then played the brother of wealthy Michael Douglas, involving him in a mind-snapping scheme in Vidas em Jogo (1997) and also landed the lead role of Sgt. Eddie Walsh in the star-studded anti-war film Al\u00e9m da Linha Vermelha (1998), before finishing the 1990s playing an offbeat jazz musician (and scoring another Oscar nomination) in Poucas e Boas (1999).The gifted and versatile Sean had also moved into directing, with the quirky but interesting Unidos Pelo Sangue (1991), about two brothers with vastly opposing views on life, and in 1995 he directed Jack Nicholson in Acerto Final (1995). Both films received overall positive reviews from critics. Moving into the new century, Sean remained busy in front of the cameras with even more outstanding work: a mentally disabled father fighting for custody of his seven-year-old daughter (and receiving a third Oscar nomination) for Uma Li\u00e7\u00e3o de Amor (2001); an anguished father seeking revenge for his daughter's murder in the gut-wrenching Clint Eastwood-directed Sobre Meninos e Lobos (2003) (for which he won the Oscar as Best Actor); a mortally ill college professor in 21 Gramas (2003) and a possessed businessman in O Assassinato de um Presidente (2004).Certainly Sean Penn is one of Hollywood's most controversial, progressive and gifted actors.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            firehouse44@hotmail.com\n          \n\n", "realName": "Sean Justin Penn", "height": "173"},

This was ironic, because being an avowed anti-fascist, he had left Germany in 1931 -- two years before Adolf Hitler came to power. The son of an aristocratic Prussian land owner, his father had intended him to embark on a military career. Instead, Peter spent his education in Berlin, where he trained as a musician.In 1937, Van Eyck arrived in New York via Havana, Cuba, and became acquainted with the composer Aaron Copland. This led to a collaboration, as well as solo efforts, as composer and lyricist on a variety of songs for revue and cabaret. He also moonlighted as a pianist in bars and nightclubs. Around this time, he also began to work as a stage manager and arranger for Irving Berlin. Not afraid to try any job that came along, he tried his hand at driving a truck, and this, somehow, led him to Hollywood where he became a protege of the director Billy Wilder. Wilder prompted him to appear in front of the cameras. In 1943, Peter began a career in films, by this time as a naturalized American citizen. For the remainder of the decade, he had little to do but re-enact basically the same part of German officers and Gestapo henchmen in films like Cinco Covas no Egito (1943) and Endere\u00e7o Desconhecido (1944).After the war, Van Eyck returned to Germany, where he was ironically cast as an American officer in Hallo, Fr\u00e4ulein! (1949). He also appeared in the comedy K\u00f6nigskinder (1950) ,with Jenny Jugo), as yet another American. One of his best ever performances as an actor was in the role of Bimba, in Henri-Georges Clouzot's high octane thriller O Sal\u00e1rio do Medo (1953). Van Eyck played one of a group of daredevil truck drivers traversing an impenetrable South American jungle with a deadly load of nitroglycerin. There were other good roles: as the womanising Frenchman Fribert in \u00cddolo do Pecado (1958); a police inspector investigating a famous murder in Dr. Crippen lebt (1958),aka 'Dr.Crippen lives'); a starring role as Paul Decker, who attempts the perfect murder of his wife in Suic\u00eddio ou Assassinato? (1958); and one of two industrialist brothers in 'Helmut Kautner''s Der Rest ist Schweigen (1959).In the 1960's, Peter Van Eyck appeared increasingly in unmemorable international co-productions. Having settled in Switzerland and maintaining a residence in Paris, he was ideally placed to alternate between French, English and German film roles. He was seen in three potboilers about the master criminal Dr.Mabuse, which were extremely popular in Germany. His best roles during this period were as the East German intelligence officer Mundt, who is the target of O Espi\u00e3o que Saiu do Frio (1965); and as Colonel General von Brock in the absorbing war drama A Ponte de Remagem (1969), which was also his last film. Van Eyck died near Zuerich in Juli 1969 of septicemia, just short of his 58th birthday.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            I.S.Mowis\n          \n\n", "realName": "G\u00f6tz von Eick", "height": null},

He shot to international fame with O Sal\u00e1rio do Medo (1953) and consolidated that success with As Diab\u00f3licas (1955), but continuous ill health caused large gaps in his output, and several projects had to be abandoned (though one, Ci\u00fame - O Inferno do Amor Possessivo (1994), was subsequently filmed by Claude Chabrol).

He was born in London in 1916 and went to live in Sydney, Australia, at the age of ten. There, he worked in a series of dead-end jobs before taking up acting, his film debut being in the mediocre comedy Dad and Dave Come to Town (1938). He made his stage debut as a comedian's stooge in 1939. Laurence Olivier spotted him and persuaded him to return to Britain to perform classic roles on the stage. Finch then had an affair with Olivier's wife, Vivien Leigh. Despite being married three times, Finch also had highly-publicized affairs with actresses Kay Kendall and Mai Zetterling. Finch soon switched to film after suffering appalling stage fright. As a screen actor, he won five BAFTA awards and his talent was beyond doubt. His two finest roles, the only two for which he received Oscar nominations, were as the homosexual Jewish doctor in Domingo Maldito (1971) and as the \"mad prophet of the air-waves\" in Rede de Intrigas (1976). He died a couple of months before being awarded the Oscar for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in Rede de Intrigas (1976) and was the first actor to have won the award posthumously.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            David Claydon <dc6212@bristol.ac.uk>\n          \n\n", "realName": "Frederick George Peter Ingle-Finch", "height": "175"},

His father, actor Martin Sheen (born Ramon Antonio Gerard Estevez), was at the time just breaking into the business, with performances on Broadway. His mother, Janet Sheen (n\u00e9e Templeton), was a former New York art student who had met Charlie's father right after he had moved to Manhattan. Martin and Janet had three other children, Emilio Estevez, Ren\u00e9e Estevez, and Ramon Estevez, all of whom became actors. His father is of half Spanish and half Irish descent, and his mother, whose family is from Kentucky, has English and Scottish ancestry.At a young age, Charlie took an interest in his father's acting career. When he was nine, he was given a small part in his dad's movie A Execu\u00e7\u00e3o do Soldado Slovik (1974). In 1977, he was in the Philippines where his dad suffered a near-fatal heart attack on the set of Apocalypse Now (1979).While at Santa Monica High School, Charlie had two major interests: acting and baseball. Along with his friends, which included Rob Lowe and Sean Penn, he produced and starred in several amateur Super-8 films. On the Vikings baseball team, he was a star shortstop and pitcher. His lifetime record as a pitcher was 40-15. His interest and skill in baseball would later influence some of his movie roles. Unfortunately, his success on the baseball field did not translate to success in the classroom, as he struggled to keep his grades up. Just a few weeks before his scheduled graduation date, Charlie was expelled due to poor attendance and bad grades.After high school, Charlie aggressively pursued many acting roles. His first major role was as a high school student in the teen war film Amanhecer Violento (1984). He followed this up with relatively small roles in TV movies and low-profile releases. His big break came in 1986 when he starred in Oliver Stone's Oscar winning epic Platoon (1986). He drew rave reviews for his portrayal of a young soldier who is caught in the center of a moral crisis in Vietnam.The success of Platoon (1986) prompted Oliver Stone to cast Charlie in his next movie Wall Street: Poder e Cobi\u00e7a (1987) alongside his father and veteran actor Martin Sheen. The movie with its \"Greed is Good\" theme became an instant hit with viewers.Shortly after, Stone approached Charlie about the starring role in his next movie, Nascido em 4 de Julho (1989). When Tom Cruise eventually got the part, Sheen ended up hearing the news from his brother Emilio Estevez and not even getting as much as a call from Stone. This led to a fallout, and the two have not worked together since.The fallout with Stone, however, did nothing to hurt Charlie's career in the late 1980s and early '90s, as he continued to establish himself as one of the top box office draws with a string of hits that included Os Jovens Pistoleiros (1988), Garra de Campe\u00f5es (1989), and Top Gang! Ases Muito Loucos (1991). However, as the mid-'90s neared, his good fortune both personally and professionally, soon came to an end.Around this time, Charlie, who had already been to drug rehab, was beginning to develop a reputation as a hard-partying, womanizer. In 1995, the same year he was briefly married to model Donna Peele, he was called to testify at the trial of Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss. At the trial, while under oath he admitted to spending nearly $50,000 on 27 of Fleiss' $2,500-a-night prostitutes.His downward spiral continued the following year when his ex-girlfriend Brittany Ashland filed charges claiming that he physically abused her. He was later charged with misdemeanor battery to which he pleaded no contest and was given a year's suspended sentence, two years' probation and a $2,800 fine. He finally hit rock bottom in May 1998 when he was hospitalized in Thousand Oaks, California, following a near-fatal drug overdose. Later that month, he was ordered back to the drug rehab center, which he had previously left after one day.During this stretch, Charlie's film career began to suffer as well. He starred in a series of box office flops that included A Invas\u00e3o (1996) and Conspira\u00e7\u00e3o (1997). However as the 1990s came to end, so did Charlie's string of bad luck.In 2000, Charlie, now clean and sober, was chosen to replace Michael J. Fox on the ABC hit sitcom Spin City (1996). Though his stint lasted only two seasons, Charlie's performance caught the eye of CBS executives who in 2003 were looking for an established star to help carry their Monday night lineup of sitcoms that included Raymond e Companhia (1996). The sitcom Dois Homens e Meio (2003) starred Charlie as a swinging, irresponsible womanizer whose life changes when his nephew suddenly appears on his doorstep. The show became a huge hit, breathing much needed life into Charlie's fading career.Charlie's personal life also appeared to be improving. In 2002, he married actress Denise Richards, whom he first met while shooting the movie O Segredo do Sucesso (2001). In March 2004, they had a daughter, Sam, and it was announced shortly after that Denise was pregnant with the couple's second child. By all reports, the couple seemed to be very happy together. However, like all of Charlie's previous relationships, the stability did not last long. In March of 2005, Denise, who was six-months pregnant, filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences. She gave birth to a second daughter, Lola, in June of that same year. Their divorce became final in late 2006.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            SteveG\n          \n\n", "realName": "Carlos Irwin Estevez", "height": "178"},

His films are filled with a variety of film angles and styles, he pushes his actors to give Oscar-worthy performances, and despite his failures, has always returned to success.William Oliver Stone was born in New York City, to Jacqueline (Goddet) and Louis Stone, a stockbroker. His American father was from a Jewish family (from Germany and Eastern Europe), and his mother, a war bride, was French (and Catholic). After dropping out of Yale University, he became a soldier in the Vietnam War. Serving in two different regiments (including 1rst Cavalry), he was introduced to The Doors, drugs, Jefferson Airplane, and other things that defined the sixties. For his actions in the war, he was awarded a Bronze Star for Gallantry and a Purple Heart. Returning from the war, Stone did not return to graduate from Yale. His first film was a student film entitled Last Year in Viet Nam (1971), followed by the gritty horror film Seizure (1974) for which he also wrote the screenplay. The next seven years saw him direct two films: Mad Man of Martinique (1979) and A M\u00e3o (1981), starring Michael Caine. He also wrote many screenplays for films such as O Expresso da Meia-Noite (1978), Conan, o B\u00e1rbaro (1982), and Scarface (1983). Stone won his first Oscar for O Expresso da Meia-Noite (1978), but his fame was just beginning to show.1986 was the year that brought him much fame to the U.S.A. and the world. He directed the political film Salvador: O Mart\u00edrio de um Povo (1986) starring Oscar-nominated James Woods. However, his big hit was the Vietnam war film Platoon (1986) starring Charlie Sheen,Willem Dafoe, Tom Berenger, and Francesco Quinn. Berenger and Dafoe received Oscar nominations for their roles as the polar opposite sergeants who each influence the tour of duty of Chris Taylor (Sheen). Stone won his first Oscar for directing this film, which won Best Picture and was a hit at the box office. After Platoon (1986), Stone followed up with the critically acclaimed Wall Street: Poder e Cobi\u00e7a (1987). The movie, starring Charlie Sheen and Michael Douglas, focuses on the business world of tycoons and stock brokers. The film was well received and won an Oscar for Douglas' portrayal of the villainous Gordon Gekko. Stone returned immediately the following year with Talk Radio: Verdades que Matam (1988), which talked of a foul-mouthed radio host (played by Eric Bogosian) who never fails to talk about the serious issues. Although it was not as successful as his last three films, Stone did not slow down at all. He directed Tom Cruise into an Oscar-nominated role in Nascido em 4 de Julho (1989).The movie talked about the return of an embittered, crippled Vietnam soldier from the war. Although it failed to win Best Picture or Best Actor, Oliver Stone won an Academy Award for Directing, his third win to date. After Nascido em 4 de Julho (1989), Stone took a hand in producing several movies, including the Academy Award-winning film O Reverso da Fortuna (1990). He returned to the director's chair in 1991, once again with two films. Val Kilmer starred as the legendary and controversial Jim Morrison in Stone's psychedelic film The Doors (1991).Despised by former Doors member Ray Manzarek, the film is nevertheless a wonderful achievement, with Kilmer pulling off an almost flawless impersonation of Morrison. Regardless of opinion, The Doors (1991) was overshadowed by Stone's colossal film JFK: A Pergunta que N\u00e3o Quer Calar (1991), which Stone himself considers the best of his films. In Stone's movie, Jim Garrison tackles the conspiracy behind the murder of America's president John F. Kennedy. The large cast featured such well-known names as Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones, John Candy, Joe Pesci, Donald Sutherland, and Walter Matthau. This film represented a change in Stone's works, because it was with this film that he really began to explore the different camera styles and combining them together to create a multi-dimensional way of showing a movie. JFK: A Pergunta que N\u00e3o Quer Calar (1991), as with Platoon (1986) and Nascido em 4 de Julho (1989), earned eight Oscar nominations and was one of Stone's most successful films. However, he failed to win a third Oscar for Best Director.After this film, Stone directed his third Vietnam film to date. Entre o C\u00e9u e a Terra (1993) was a film about the war from the viewpoint of a Vietnamese girl, and also co-starred Tommy Lee Jones (who had received an Oscar nomination for JFK: A Pergunta que N\u00e3o Quer Calar (1991)). Despite its new woman's perspective and several positive reviews, it was a box office failure. Stone was unfazed; his next film is perhaps his most notorious film to date. Adapting a screenplay by Quentin Tarantino, Stone made Assassinos por Natureza (1994) starring Woody Harrelson, Juliette Lewis, Tom Sizemore and Rodney Dangerfield in his only dramatic performance. The film was received well at the box office, while review were very mixed. Because of the violence that people claimed was inspired by the film, it was compared to Stanley Kubrick's Laranja Mec\u00e2nica (1971). As usual, Stone was at the center of controversial subjects; his next film Nixon (1995) was no exception. The film focused on the life of President Richard Nixon, played by Anthony Hopkins, while featuring another well-known cast, including Joan Allen in the role of Nixon's wife. Both went on to receive Oscar nominations, while Stone received his sixth Oscar nomination for Screenwriting. The film got mixed reviews, and failed to recoup its budget.Aside from directing, Stone has worked as a producer on several different films. There was, of course, the successful film O Reverso da Fortuna (1990), which won Jeremy Irons an Oscar and also nominated the director for an Oscar. There was also the highly praised and successful emotional drama O Clube da Felicidade e da Sorte (1993) which centered around four Chinese immigrant women whose relationships with their daughters is affected by their own lives. Another highly praised Oscar nominated film was Milos Forman's classic film O Povo Contra Larry Flint (1996) starring Woody Harrelson, Edward Norton, and Courtney Love. Whether the crime/action film O Corruptor (1999) or the brilliant war epic Savior - A \u00daltima Guerra (1998), Stone has worked in a variety of film genres.Stone had directed ten films in nine years; now however, he began to slow down. He directed the film Reviravolta (1997) starring Sean Penn and Jennifer Lopez. As with Assassinos por Natureza (1994), it was a dark and twisted satire on violence, but did not have the same success as the former. Stone was set to direct several projects in the late 90's but they fell through and were not made. However, success came back to Stone in the Al Pacino film Um Domingo Qualquer (1999). This sports movie centered on the life behind the game of football, and it starred an impressive cast that included frequent Stone collaborators James Woods and John C. McGinley. This film was one of his most successful box office films, and put him back on track.The following years brought Stone no new theatrical films, though he did make three fascinating TV documentaries. Two of them, 'Looking for Fidel' and Comandante (2003) were interviews of Cuban dictator Fidel Castro, while 'Persona Non Grata' was an interview of several Palestinian leaders. Stone was also set to direct Psicopata Americano (2000) with Leonardo DiCaprio and Amor sem Fronteiras (2003), starring Angelina Jolie and at the time, Ralph Fiennes. However, Stone dropped out of both projects, as did a number of the actors mentioned. Finally, five years after Um Domingo Qualquer (1999), Stone directed a film he'd long wanted to make; the colossal epic Alexandre (2004). Starring Colin Farrell as the Macedonian leader, Stone attempted to capture the essence of Alexander the Great through his conquests of the known world. The film focused on Alexander's relationships with his parents (a brilliant performance by Val Kilmer and a less impressive one by Angelina Jolie) and his relationships with his wife and childhood friend/ gay lover (played by Rosario Dawson and Jared Leto respectively).Alexandre (2004) was a critical failure, and failed to win back its budget domestically. Despite being one of 2004's highest grossing films internationally, and recouping its budget through DVD sales, Stone's pet project was heavily criticized. Despite a far superior version (Alexander Revisited) being released on DVD, the film's reputation remains low by the majority. Stone was personally stung at these attacks, but managed to rebound, if mildly, with his hopeful film As Torres G\u00eameas (2006). The film centers on two firefighters trapped in the rubble of the twin towers. It received good reviews, and allowed Oliver to step forward from his failure towards the possibility of more films.In late 2007, besides a number of projects Stone was set to direct \"Pinkville\", which would have been his fourth Vietnam film to date. It was set to star a large number of well known actors such as Bruce Willis, Toby Jones, Channing Tatum, Michael Pitt, Woody Harrelson, and Michael Pe\u00f1a. However, a week before shooting was to begin, the Writer's Strike was started, and the finance for the film was cut, using the strike as an excuse. After Willis backed out of the project, it was eventually scuttled, much like Stone's early productions of Platoon (1986) and Nascido em 4 de Julho (1989). Stone turned to another project he had worked on with former Wall Street: Poder e Cobi\u00e7a (1987) collaborator Stanley Weiser. The project was W. (2008), a biography on president George W. Bush. Stone initially cast Christian Bale in the role of Bush but the actor dropped out at the last minute. Josh Brolin was cast, and this followed with a large cast of well known Oscar nominated character actors such as Richard Dreyfuss, James Cromwell, and Ellen Burstyn. The film was made in a record four months, starting in June and released in October. The film opened to mixed reviews, and though film's budget was recouped, it was not a financial hit.Stone then made the documentary Ao Sul da Fronteira (2009), a documentary which focused on bringing to light the positive aspects of the left-wing governments in South America, particularly Hugo Chavez in Venezuela. Stone was much less critical than usual, instead making the documentary as a response to the harsh reputation that Chavez has in the States. The documentary was poorly received in the States. Stone also began work on Wall Street: O Dinheiro Nunca Dorme (2010). Starring Michael Douglas, Shia LaBeouf, Josh Brolin, Carey Mulligan, and Eli Wallach, the film focuses on the 2008 economic crisis, and the return of Gordon Gekko from prison. The film was screened at Cannes to positive reception, and hailed as Stone's triumphant return. After this, Stone made a film adaptation of \"Savages\", a novel by Don Winslow. The movie follows two highly successful marijuana growers (Taylor Kitsch and Aaron Taylor-Johnson ), whose shared girlfriend (Blake Lively) is kidnapped by a Mexican cartel and held for ransom. The movie also starred Salma Hayek, Benicio Del Toro, John Travolta, and Emile Hirsch. The film was a return to the tense action and violence of Stone's earlier films, though it polarized many audience members due to the colorful narrations of Lively's vapid and naive character, as well as the film's ending.After completing the ambitious and well-received television project A Hist\u00f3ria N\u00e3o Contada dos Estados Unidos (2012), as well as a documentary on Hugo Chavez, Stone finally returned to feature films with Snowden: Her\u00f3i ou Traidor (2016). Based on the life of American whistle blower Edward Snowden, Stone's film depicted his awakening to the truth behind the massive surveillances conducted by the NSA, and his attempt to warn the general public of what they did not know. The film was done independently, financed by Europeans on a low budget. It was also a return to form for Stone in a way that had not been seen since \"Alexander\". Joseph Gordon-Levitt, delivered a very strong performance as Snowden, with the supporting cast including Shailene Woodley, Rhys Ifans, Melissa Leo, Timothy Olyphant, and Nicolas Cage. Sadly, the film received a mixed response from critics, and was a box office disappointment.Since then, Stone has returned to television for his next two projects. One is a series of interviews with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, and the other is directing a new fictional series based on the abusive Guantanamo prison. It will be his first venture into fictional television.Oliver Stone is a three-time Oscar winner, and although he has mostly been stung by critics of his films, he remains a well-known name today in the film industry. The films he directed have been nominated for 31 Academy Awards, including eight for acting, six for screen writing, and three for directing. There is no denying that Stone has cemented himself a position among the legends of Hollywood.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Bob Stage\n          \n\n", "realName": "William Oliver Stone", "height": "183"},

He spent his early years in various foster homes before being adopted by the Dreyers at the age of two. Contrary to popular belief (perhaps nourished by the fact that his films often deal with religious themes) Dreyer did not receive a strict Lutheran upbringing, but was raised in a household that embraced modern ideas: in his spare time the adoptive father was an avid photographer, and the Dreyers voted for The Danish Social Democrates. When he was baptized the reasoning was culturally, not religiously motivated. Dreyer's childhood was an unhappy one. He did not feel his adoptive parents' love (especially the mother), and longed for his biological mother, whom he never knew.After working as a journalist, he entered the film industry, and advanced from reading scripts to directing films himself. In the silent era his output was large, but it quickly diminished with the arrival of the talkie. In his lifetime he was recognized as being a fanatical perfectionist amongst producers, and thus difficult to work with. His career was dogged by problems with the financing of his films, which led to large gaps in his output - and after the critics, too, denounced O Vampiro (1932), he returned to journalism in 1932, and became a cinema manager in 1952 - though he still made features up to the mid- 1960s, a few years before his death. His films are typically slow, intense studies of human psychology, usually of people undergoing extreme personal or religious crises. He is now regarded as the greatest director ever to emerge from Denmark.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Michael Brooke <michael@everyman.demon.co.uk>, Peter Christian Rude\n          \n\n", "realName": null, "height": "170"},

The purpose of the organization was to prepare the boys for military service. At age 15, Hardy made his film debut in a German picture (Junge Adler (1944)), but his acting career was interrupted when he was drafted into the German army in 1944 at age 16 and posted to an infantry regiment.Years later, Hardy related how he \"hated that [Nazi] uniform.\" During the filming of Uma Ponte Longe Demais (1977) in which he portrayed a Nazi general, he wore a top-coat over his S.S. uniform between takes so as \"not to remind myself of my childhood in Germany during W.W.II.\" It is said that during his war years, Hardy was captured and taken prisoner by U.S. forces but attempted to escape thrice, the third time successfully.After the war Hardy returned to acting, and eight years later was \"discovered\" by foreign film distributor J. Arthur Rank, which promptly cast him in three British pictures practically filmed back-to-back: \u00c1guia Fugitiva (1957), Sat\u00e3 \u00e0 Meia-Noite (1958) and Entrevista com a Morte (1959), in which he appeared simply as a foreigner and not a German, as was usually the case. Following the release of these films Hardy's career took off. Despite anti-German sentiment that still prevailed in postwar Europe, Hardy, described as \"ruggedly handsome\" and a \"blond heartthrob\", became an international favorite, paving the way to his first American role as co-star with John Wayne in the Tanganyika-shot wildlife adventure Hatari (1962).Hardy was so taken aback by the beauty of the land that he bought the film's location (\"Momilla Farm\") and built a small home for himself and a small bungalow hotel for tourists to see the animals. Hunting was forbidden on the property, and later a cattle farm was started with the meat being sold to local hotels. Hardy described his home there as \"a sort of African Walden where I can get away from the world from time to time.\"In 1979, due to the dissolution of the alliance of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania (formerly Tanganyika), the border with Kenya was closed and remained so for half a decade, which caused a serious decline in tourism. The business aspects of his property were shut down for a period of time but eventually things picked up and the place was transformed into a proper tourist hotel, known (fittingly) as Hatari Lodge.Fluent in English, French and German, Hardy found himself in much demand by British, French, American and German producers and became more selective in his scripts. \"I'd rather sit out a picture than take a role I don't think is right for me\" he would later say.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Tom Hernandez (qv's & corrections by A.

Richard started early as a musician, playing a number of instruments in high school and writing music for high school productions. He graduated from North Syracuse Central High School in 1967, and won a gymnastics scholarship to the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, where he majored in philosophy. He left college after two years to pursue acting, landing a lead role in the London production of the rock musical \"Grease\" in 1973. The following year he would be in other plays, such as \"Taming of the Shrew.\" Onscreen, he had a few roles, and gained recognition in \u00c0 Procura de Mr. Goodbar (1977). Offscreen, he spent 1978 meeting Tibetans when he traveled to Nepal, where he spoke to many monks and lamas. Returning to the US, on Broadway he portrayed a concentration-camp prisoner in \"Bent,\" for which he received the 1980 Theatre World Award. Back in Hollywood, he played the title role in Gigol\u00f4 Americano (1980), establishing himself as a major star; this status was reaffirmed by A For\u00e7a do Destino (1982). In the early 1980s, Richard went to Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador (amidst ongoing wars and political violence); he traveled with a doctor and visited refugee camps. It is said that Richard was romantically linked with Tuesday Weld, Priscilla Presley, Barbra Streisand and Kim Basinger. In 1990 Richard teamed up with Julia Roberts to star in the blockbuster Uma Linda Mulher (1990); his cool reserve was the perfect complement to Julia's bubbling enthusiasm. The film captured the nation's heart, and won the People's Choice award for Best Movie. Fans clamored for years for a sequel, or at least another pairing of Julia and Richard. They got that with Noiva em Fuga (1999), which was a runaway success (Richard got $12 million, Julia made $17 million, the box office was $152 million, which shows what happens when you give the public what it wants!). Offscreen, Richard and Cindy Crawford got married December 12, 1991 (they were divorced in 1995). Afterwards, Richard started dating actress Carey Lowell. They had a son, Homer James Jigme Gere, on February 6, 2000. Richard was picked by People magazine as one of the 50 Most Beautiful People in the world in 1991, and as their Sexiest Man Alive in 1999.

He has been an active supporter of \"Survival International\" for several years, a worldwide organization supporting tribal peoples, affirming their right to decide their own future and helping them protect their lives, lands and human rights (these tribes are global, including the natives of the Amazon, the Maasai of East Africa, the Wichi of Argentina, and others).

Following a spell with the Royal National Theatre in the mid 1980s, he went to Los Angeles, California to star on Jornada nas Estrelas: A Nova Gera\u00e7\u00e3o (1987), which ran from 1987-1994, playing the role of Captain Jean-Luc Picard. After the series ended, Stewart reprised his role for a string of successful Star Trek films: Jornada nas Estrelas: Generations (1994), Jornada nas Estrelas: Primeiro Contato (1996), Jornada nas Estrelas: Insurrei\u00e7\u00e3o (1998), and Jornada Nas Estrelas: N\u00eamesis (2002). Stewart continues to work on the stage and in various films. He was awarded Knight Bachelor of the Order of the British Empire in the 2010 Queen's New Year's Honours List for his services to drama.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            International Audience Alliance for Patrick Stewart (IAAPS)\n          \n\n", "realName": "Patrick Stewart", "height": "178"},

As a Hollywood star, he appeared in 100 films over the course of 60 years. He played Moses in the epic film, The Ten Commandments (1956), for which he received his first Golden Globe Award nomination. He also starred in Touch of Evil (1958) with Orson Welles; Ben-Hur, for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor (1959); El Cid (1961); and Planet of the Apes (1968). He also starred in the films The Greatest Show on Earth (1952); Secret of the Incas (1954); The Big Country (1958); and The Agony and the Ecstasy (1965). A supporter of Democratic politicians and civil rights in the 1960s, Heston later became a Republican, founding a conservative political action committee and supporting Ronald Reagan. Heston's most famous role in politics came as the five-term president of the National Rifle Association, from 1998 to 2003.Heston was born John Charles Carter on October 4, 1924, in No Man's Land, Illinois, to Lila (Charlton) and Russell Whitford Carter, who operated a sawmill. He had English and Scottish ancestry, with recent Canadian forebears.Heston made his feature film debut as the lead character in a 16mm production of Peer Gynt (1941), based on the Henrik Ibsen play. In 1944, Heston enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces. He served for two years as a radio operator and aerial gunner aboard a B-25 Mitchell stationed in the Alaskan Aleutian Islands with the 77th Bombardment Squadron of the Eleventh Air Force. He reached the rank of Staff Sergeant. Heston married Northwestern University student Lydia Marie Clarke, who was six months his senior. That same year he joined the military.Heston played 'Marc Antony' in Julius Caesar (1950), and firmly stamped himself as genuine leading man material with his performance as circus manager 'Brad Braden' in the Cecil B. DeMille spectacular O Maior Espet\u00e1culo da Terra (1952), also starring James Stewart and Cornel Wilde. The now very popular actor remained perpetually busy during the 1950s, both on TV and on the silver screen with audience pleasing performances in the steamy thriller A Selva Nua (1954), as a treasure hunter in O Segredo dos Incas (1954) and another barn storming performance for Cecil B. DeMille as \"Moses\" in the blockbuster Os Dez Mandamentos (1956).Heston delivered further dynamic performances in the oily film noir thriller A Marca da Maldade (1958), and then alongside Gregory Peck in the western Da Terra Nascem os Homens (1958) before scoring the role for which he is arguably best known, that of the wronged Jewish prince who seeks his freedom and revenge in the William Wyler directed Ben-Hur (1959). This mammoth Biblical epic running in excess of three and a half hours became the standard by which other large scale productions would be judged, and it's superb cast also including Stephen Boyd as the villainous \"Massala\", English actor Jack Hawkins as the Roman officer \"Quintus Arrius\", and Australian actor Frank Thring as \"Pontius Pilate\", all contributed wonderful performances. Never one to rest on his laurels, steely Heston remained the preferred choice of directors to lead the cast in major historical productions and during the 1960s he starred as Spanish legend \"Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar\" in El Cid (1961), as a US soldier battling hostile Chinese boxers during 55 Dias em Pequim (1963), played the ill-fated \"John the Baptist\" in A Maior Hist\u00f3ria de Todos os Tempos (1965), the masterful painter \"Michelangelo\" battling Pope Julius II in Agonia e \u00caxtase (1965), and an English general in Khartoum (1966). In 1968, Heston filmed the unusual western ...E o Bravo Ficou S\u00f3 (1967) about an aging and lonely cowboy befriending a lost woman and her son, which Heston has often referred to as his favorite piece of work on screen. Interestingly, Heston was on the verge of acquiring an entirely new league of fans due to his appearance in four very topical science fiction films (all based on popular novels) painting bleak future's for mankind.In 1968, Heston starred as time traveling astronaut \"George Taylor\", in the terrific O Planeta dos Macacos (1968) with it's now legendary conclusion as Heston realizes the true horror of his destination. He returned to reprise the role, albeit primarily as a cameo, alongside fellow astronaut James Franciscus in the slightly inferior sequel De Volta ao Planeta dos Macacos (1970). Next up, Heston again found himself facing the apocalypse in A \u00daltima Esperan\u00e7a da Terra (1971) as the survivor of a germ plague that has wiped out humanity leaving only bands of psychotic lunatics roaming the cities who seek to kill the uninfected Heston. And fourthly, taking its inspiration from the Harry Harrison novel \"Make Room!, Make Room!\", Heston starred alongside screen legend Edward G. Robinson and Chuck Connors in No Mundo de 2020 (1973). During the remainder of the 1970s, Heston appeared in two very popular \"disaster movies\" contributing lead roles in the far fetched Aeroporto 75 (1974), plus in the star laden Terremoto (1974), filmed in \"Sensoround\" (low bass speakers were installed in selected theaters to simulate the earthquake rumblings on screen to movie audiences). He played an evil Cardinal in the lively A Vingan\u00e7a de Milady (1974), a mythical US naval officer in the recreation of A Batalha de Midway (1976), also filmed in \"Sensoround\", an LA cop trying to stop a sniper in P\u00e2nico na Multid\u00e3o (1976) and another US naval officer in the submarine thriller S.O.S. - Submarino Nuclear (1978). Heston appeared in numerous episodes of the high rating TV series Dinastia (1981) and The Colbys (1985), before moving onto a mixed bag of projects including TV adaptations of A Ilha do Tesouro (1990) and A Man for All Seasons (1988), hosting two episodes of the comedy show, Saturday Night Live (1975), starring as the \"Good Actor\" bringing love struck Mike Myers to tears in Quanto Mais Idiota Melhor 2 (1993), and as the eye patch wearing boss of intelligence agent Arnold Schwarzenegger in True Lies (1994). He also narrated numerous TV specials and lent his vocal talents to the animated movie H\u00e9rcules (1997), the family comedy Como C\u00e3es e Gatos (2001) and an animated version of Ben Hur (2003). Heston made an uncredited appearance in the inferior remake of O Planeta dos Macacos (2001), and his last film appearance to date was in the Holocaust themed drama of My Father, Rua Alguem 5555 (2003).Heston narrated for highly classified military and Department of Energy instructional films, particularly relating to nuclear weapons, and \"for six years Heston [held] the nation's highest security clearance\" or Q clearance.\" The Q clearance is similar to a DoD or Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) clearance of Top Secret.Heston was married to Lydia Marie Clark Heston since March 1944, and they have two children. His highly entertaining autobiography was released in 1995, titled appropriately enough \"Into The Arena\". Although often criticized for his strong conservative beliefs and involvement with the NRA, Heston was a strong advocate for civil right many years before it became fashionable, and was a recipient of the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, plus the Kennedy Center Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2002, he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, and did appear in a film or TV production after 2003. He died in April 2008. Truly, Charlton Heston is one of the legendary figures of US cinema.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Ray Hamel, firehouse44, and Pedro Borges\n          \n\n", "realName": "John Charles Carter", "height": "191"},

He attended Glengormley & Ballyrobert primary school and then moved on to Ballyclare High School and studied bookkeeping at Hughes Commercial Academy. In Ireland he worked in an insurance office and travel agency during the day and rehearsed with a semi-professional acting company at night during the week and weekends. He would eventually manage to be on the list for professional acting companies to call him when they had a role. He joined the Ulster Theatre Group and was a leading man with that company for three years, playing all kinds of roles. He did quite a bit of radio work in between as well, but then decided it was distracting him from acting and completely surrendered to his passion. Eventually he went to London as an understudy in an Irish play, \"The Passing Day\".In England he became very ill and was in and out of work, supplementing his acting assignments with odd jobs such as waiting in a cafeteria, doorman at the Odeon Theatre and even busking on the streets of London. Even as things turned for the worst, he would always write back to his mother that all was well and things were moving along so as not to alarm her in any way or make her worry. Sir Michael Redgrave discovered him one night at the Odeon Theatre and arranged an introduction to the Windsor Repertory Company. The Arts Council of Great Britain was looking for leading man and part-time director for the only major repertory company that was left in England, The Arts Council Midland Theatre Company, and he got the job. During his stay in England he went into television with the BBC, and for 18 months he was in every big play on TV. One of the major roles in his early career was the one in the play \"Barnett's Folly\", which he himself ranked as one of his favorites.In 1956 he signed a seven-year contract with 20th Century-Fox. This led to his first film role, as an IRA member spying for the Nazis in O Homem que Nunca Existiu (1956), a job he was offered by legendary producer Alexander Korda. William Wyler was so struck by Boyd's performance in that film that he asked Fox to loan him Boyd, resulting in his being cast in what is probably his most famous role, that of Messala in the classic Ben-Hur (1959) opposite Charlton Heston. He received a Golden Globe award for his work on that film but was surprisingly bypassed on Oscar night. Still under contract with Fox, Boyd waited around to play the role of Marc Anthony in Cle\u00f3patra (1963) opposite Elizabeth Taylor. However, Taylor became so seriously ill that the production was delayed for months, which caused Boyd and other actors to withdraw from the film and move on to other projects.Boyd made several films under contract before going independent. One of the highlights was Viagem Fant\u00e1stica (1966), a science-fiction film about a crew of scientists miniaturized and injected into the human body as if in inner space. He also received a nomination for his role of Insp. Jongman in O Inspetor (1962) (aka \"The Inspector\") co-starring with Dolores Hart.Boyd's Hollywood career began to fade by the late 1960s as he started to spend more time in Europe, where he seemed to find better roles more suited to his interests. When he went independent it was obvious that he took on roles that spoke to him rather than just taking on assignments for the money, and several of the projects he undertook were, at the time, quite controversial, such as Slaves (1969) and Carter's Army (1970). Boyd chose his roles based solely on character development and the value of the story that was told to the public, and never based on monetary compensation or peer pressure.Although at the height of his career he was considered one of Hollywood's leading men, he never forgot where he came from, and always reminded everyone that he was, first and foremost, an Irishman. When the money started coming in, one of the first things he did was to ensure that his family was taken care of. He was particularly close to his mother Martha and his brother Alex.Boyd was married twice, the first time in 1958 to Italian-born MCA executive Mariella di Sarzana, but that only lasted (officially) during the filming of \"Ben Hur\". His second marriage was to Elizabeth Mills, secretary at the British Arts Council and a friend since 1955. Liz Mills followed Boyd to the US in the late 1950s and was his personal assistant and secretary for years before they married, about ten months before his death. He died on June 2, 1977, in Northridge, California, from a massive heart attack while playing golf - one of his favorite pastimes - at the Porter Valley Country Club. He is buried at Oakwood Memorial Park in Chatsworth, California. It was a terrible loss, just as he seemed to be making a comeback with his recent roles in the series Hawaii Five-O (1968) and the English movie Abomin\u00e1vel Extors\u00e3o (1977).It is a real tragedy to see that a man who was so passionate about his work, who wanted nothing but to tell a story with character, a man who was ahead of his time in many ways ended up being overlooked by many of his peers. One fact remains about Stephen Boyd, however--his fans are still passionate about his work to this day, almost 30 years after his death, and one has to wonder if he ever realized that perhaps in some way he achieved the goal he set out for himself: to entertain the public and draw attention to the true art of acting while maintaining glamour as he defined it by remaining himself a mystery.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Brigitte Ivory\n          \n\n", "realName": "William Millar", "height": "183"},

The winner of three Best Director Academy Awards, second again only to Ford's four, Wyler's reputation has unfairly suffered as the lack of an obvious \"signature\" in his diverse body of work denies him the honorific \"auteur\" that has become a standard measure of greatness in the post-\"Cahiers du Cinema\" critical community.His directorial career spanned 45 years, from silent pictures to the cultural revolution of the 1970s. Nominated a record 12 times for an Academy Award as Best Director, he won three and in 1966, was honored with the Irving Thalberg Award, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences' ultimate accolade for a producer. So high was his reputation in his lifetime that he was the fourth recipient of the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award, after Ford, James Cagney and Welles. Along with Ford and Welles, Wyler ranks with the best and most influential American directors, including Griffith, DeMille, Frank Capra, Howard Hawks, Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg.Born Willi Wyler on July 1, 1902, in Mulhouse, Alsace (then a possession of Germany), to Jewish parents. His Swiss-born father, Leopold, started as a traveling salesman but later became a thriving haberdasher in Mulhouse. His mother, Melanie (n\u00e9e Auerbach; died February 13, 1955, Los Angeles, aged 77), was German-born, and a cousin of Carl Laemmle, founder of Universal Pictures. Melanie Wyler often took him and his older brother Robert to concerts, opera, and the theatre, as well as the early cinema. Sometimes at home his family and their friends would stage amateur theatricals for personal enjoyment.He used his family connections to establish himself in the film industry. Upon being offered a job by his mother's first cousin, Universal Studios head Carl Laemmle, Wyler emigrated to the US in 1920 at the age of 18. After starting in Universal's New York offices as an errand boy, he moved his way up through the organization, ending up in the California operation in 1922. Wyler was given the opportunity to direct in July 1925, with the two-reel western The Crook Buster (1925). It was on this film that he was first credited as William Wyler, though he never officially changed his name and would be known as \"Willi\" all his life. For almost five years he performed his apprenticeship in Universal's \"B\" unit, turning out a score of low-budget silent westerns. In 1929 he made his first \"A\" picture, Os Tr\u00eas Padrinhos (1929), Universal's first all-sound movie shot outside a studio. The western, the first version of the \"Three Godfathers\" story, was a commercial and critical success.The initial years of the Great Depression brought hard times for the film industry, and Universal went into receivership in 1932, partially due to financial troubles brought about by rampant nepotism and the runaway production costs rung up by producer Carl Laemmle Jr., the son of the boss. There were 70 Laemmle family members on the Universal payroll at one point, including Wyler. In 1935 \"Uncle\" Carl was forced to sell the studio he had created in 1912 with the 1912 merger of his Independent Motion Picture Co. with several other production companies. Wyler continued to direct for Universal up until the end of the family regime, helming O Conselheiro (1933), the film version of Elmer Rice's play featuring one of John Barrymore's more restrained performances, and A Boa Fada (1935), a comedy adapted from a Ferenc Moln\u00e1r play by Preston Sturges and starring Margaret Sullavan, who was Wyler's wife for a short time. Both films were produced by his cousin, \"Junior\" Laemmle. Emancipated from the Laemmle family, Wyler subsequently established himself as a major director in the mid-1930s, when he began directing films for independent producer Samuel Goldwyn. Willi would soon find his freedom fettered by the man with the fabled \"Goldwyn touch,\" which entailed bullying his directors to recast, rewrite and recut their films, and sometimes replacing them during shooting.The first of the Wyler-Goldwyn works was Inf\u00e2mia (1936), based on Lillian Hellman's lesbian-themed play \"The Children's Hour\" (the Sapphic theme was jettisoned and sanitized into a conventional heterosexual love triangle due to censorship concerns, but it resurfaced intact when Wyler remade the film a quarter-century later). His first unqualified success for Goldwyn was Fogo de Outono (1936), an adaptation of Sinclair Lewis' portrait of a disintegrating American marriage, a marvelous film that still resonates with audiences in the 21st century. He received his first Best Director Oscar nomination for this picture. The film was nominated for Best Picture, the first of seven straight years in which a Wyler-directed movie would earn that accolade, culminating with Oscars for both William Wyler and Rosa de Esperan\u00e7a (1942) in 1942.Wyler's potential greatness can be seen as early as \"Hell's Heroes,\" an early talkie that is not constrained by the restrictions of the new technology. The climax of the picture, with Charles Bickford's dying badman walking into town, is a long tracking shot that focuses not on the actor himself but the detritus that he shucks off to lighten his load as he brings a baby back to a cradle of civilization. The scene is a harbinger of the free-flowing style that would become a hallmark of his work. However, it was with \"Dodsworth\" that Wyler began to establish his critical reputation. The film features long takes and a probing camera, a style that Wyler would make his own. Now established as Goldwyn's director of choice, Wyler made several films for him, including Beco sem Sa\u00edda (1937) and O Morro dos Ventos Uivantes (1939). Essentially an employee of the producer, Wyler clashed with Goldwyn over aesthetic choices and longed for his freedom. Goldwyn had demanded that the ghetto set of \"Dead End\" be spruced up and that \"clean garbage\" be used in the water tank representing the East River, over Wyler's objections. Goldwyn prevailed, as he did later with the ending of \"Wuthering Heights.\" After he had finished principal photography on the film, Goldwyn demanded a new ending featuring the ghosts of Heathcliff and Cathy reunited and walking away towards what the audience would assume is heaven and an eternity of conjoined bliss. Wyler opposed the new ending and refused to shoot it. Goldwyn had his ending shot without Wyler and had it tacked onto the final cut. It was an artistic betrayal that rankled Wyler.Goldwyn loaned out Wyler to other studios, and he made Jezebel (1938) and A Carta (1940) for Warner Bros. Working with Bette Davis in the two masterpieces, as well as in Goldwyn's P\u00e9rfida (1941), Wyler elicited three of the great diva's finest performances. In these films and his films of the mid-to-late 1930s, Wyler pioneered the use of deep-focus cinematography, most famously with lighting cameraman Gregg Toland. Toland shot seven of the eight films Wyler directed for Goldwyn: \"These Three\", Meu Filho \u00e9 Meu Rival (1936), \"Dead End,\" \"Wuthering Heights\" (for which Toland won his only Academy Award), O Galante Aventureiro (1940), \"The Little Foxes\" and Os Melhores Anos de Nossa Vida (1946). Compositions in Wyler pictures frequently featured multiple horizontal planes with various characters arranged in diagonals at varying distances from the camera lens. Creating an illusion of depth, these deep-focus shots enhanced the naturalism of the picture while heightening the drama. As the photography of Wyler's films was used to serve the story and create mood rather than call attention to itself, Toland was later mistakenly given credit for creating deep-focus cinematography along with another great director, Orson Welles, in Cidad\u00e3o Kane (1941). His first use of deep-focus cinematography was in 1935, with \"The Good Fairy\", on which Norbert Brodine was the lighting cameraman. It was the first of his films featuring deep-focus shots and the diagonal compositions that became a Wyler leitmotif. The film also includes a receding mirror shot a half-decade before Toland and Welles created a similar one for \"Citizen Kane.\"Wyler won his first Oscar as Best Director with \"Mrs. Miniver\" for MGM, which also won the Oscar for Best Picture, the first of three Wyler films that would be so honored. Made as a propaganda piece for American audiences to prepare them for the sacrifices necessitated by World War II, the movie is set in wartime England and elucidates the hardships suffered by an ordinary, middle-class English family coping with the war. An enthusiastic President Franklin D. Roosevelt, after seeing the film at a White House screening, said, \"This has to be shown right away.\" The film also won Oscars for star Greer Garson and co-star Theresa Wright, for cinematographer Joseph Ruttenberg and for Best Screenplay.After \"Miniver,\" Wyler went off to war as an officer in the U.S. Army Air Corps. One of his more memorable propaganda films of the period was a documentary about a B-17 bomber, The Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress (1944), He also directed the Navy documentary Belonave (1944), an examination of life aboard an American aircraft carrier. Though the later film won an Oscar as Best Documentary, \"The Memphis Belle\" is considered a classic of its form. The making of the documentary was even the subject of a 1990 feature film of the same name. \"The Memphis Belle\" focuses on the eponymous B-17 bomber and its 25th, and last, air raid flown from a base in England. The documentary features aerial battle footage that Wyler and his crew shot over the skies of Germany. One of his photographic crew, flying in another plane, was killed during the filming of the air battles. Wyler himself lost the hearing in one ear and became partially deaf in the other due to the noise and concussion of the flak bursting around his aircraft.Wyler's first picture upon returning from World War II would prove to be the last movie he made for Goldwyn. A returning veteran like those portrayed in \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" (1946), this film won Wyler his second Oscar. The movie, which featured a moving performance by real-life veteran and double amputee Harold Russell, struck a universal chord with Americans and was a major box office hit. It was the second Wyler-directed picture to be named Best Picture at the Academy Awards. The film also won Oscars for star Fredric March and co-star Russell (who was also given an honorary award \"for bringing hope and courage to his fellow veterans\"), film editor Daniel Mandell, composer Hugo Friedhofer and screenwriter Robert E. Sherwood, and was instrumental in garnering the Irving Thalberg Award for Samuel Goldwyn, who also took home the Best Picture Oscar that year as \"Best Years\" producer.Though Wyler elicited some of the finest performances preserved on film, ironically he could not communicate what he wanted to an actor. A perfectionist, he became known as \"40-Take Wyler\", shooting a scene over and over again until the actors played it the way he wanted. With his use of long takes, actors were forced to act within each take as their performances would not be covered in the cutting room. His long takes and lack of cutting slowed down the pacing of his films, providing a greater feeling of continuity within each scene and intimately involving the audience in the development of the drama. The story in a Wyler film was allowed to unfold organically, with no tricky editing to cover up holes in the script or to compensate for an inadequate performance. Wyler typically rehearsed his actors for two weeks before the beginning of principal photography.While more actors won Academy Awards in Wyler movies, 14 out of a total of 36 nominations (more than any other two directors combined), few actors worked more than once or twice with him. Bette Davis worked on three films with him and won Academy Award nominations for each performance and an Oscar for \"Jezebel.\" On their last collaboration, \"The Little Foxes\" (1941), Davis walked off the production for two weeks after clashing with Wyler over how her character should be played.He proved hard on other experienced actors, such as Laurence Olivier in \"Wuthering Heights,\" who gave credit to Willi for turning him from a stage actor into a movie actor. \"This isn't the Opera House in Manchester,\" Wyler told Olivier, his way of conveying that he should tone down his performance. A year earlier, Wyler had forced Henry Fonda through 40 takes on the set of \"Jezebel,\" Wyler's only direction being \"Again\" after each repeated take. When Fonda demanded some input on what he was doing wrong, Wyler replied only: \"It stinks. Do it again.\" According to Charlton Heston, Wyler approached him early in the shooting of Ben-Hur (1959) and told him that his performance was inadequate. When a dismayed Heston asked him what he should do, \"Be better\" is all that Wyler could supply. In his autobiography, Elia Kazan, a famed \"actor's director\", tells how he offered advice to an actor acquaintance of his who was making a Wyler picture as he knew that the great director was inarticulate about acting and would be unable to give advice.Wyler believed that after many takes, actors got angry and began to shed their preconceived ideas about acting in general and the part in particular. Stripped of these notions, actors were able to play at a truer level. It is a process that Stanley Kubrick would subsequently use on his post-2001: Uma Odiss\u00e9ia no Espa\u00e7o (1968) films, though to different results, creating an otherworldly anti-realism rather than the more naturalistic truth of a Wyler movie performance. His methods often meant that his films went over schedule and over budget, but he got results. Wyler's reputation has suffered as he is not considered an \"auteur,\" or \"author\" of his films. However, in his postwar career, he definitely was the auteur, or controlling consciousness, behind his films. Although he never took a screenwriting credit (other than for an early horse opera, Ridin' for Love (1926)), he selected his own stories and controlled the screenwriting, hiring his own writers in a development process that could take years. His postwar period films include Tarde Demais (1949), a fine version of Henry James' novel \"Washington Square,\" with an Oscar-winning performance by Olivia de Havilland; Chaga de Fogo (1951), a police drama that takes place on a minimal, controlled set almost as restricted as that of Hitchcock's Festim Diab\u00f3lico (1948); and A Princesa e o Plebeu (1953), which won Audrey Hepburn an Oscar in her first leading role. The other films of this period are Perdi\u00e7\u00e3o por Amor (1952), Horas de Desespero (1955) and Sublime Tenta\u00e7\u00e3o (1956).Wyler returned to the western genre one last time with Da Terra Nascem os Homens (1958), a picture far removed in scope from his two-reeler origins, featuring Gregory Peck, Heston, and Wyler's old \"Hell's Heroes\" star Bickford. Burl Ives won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role as the patriarch of an outlaw clan in conflict with Bickford's family. Wyler was next enlisted by producer Sam Zimbalist to helm MGM's high-stakes \"Ben-Hur\" (1959), a remake of its 1925 classic. It was a high-budget ($15 million, approximately $90 million when factored for inflation), wide-screen (the aspect ratio of the film is 2.76 to 1 when properly shown in 70mm anamorphic prints, the highest ratio ever used for a film) epic that the studio had spent six years preparing. Principal photography required more than six months of shooting on location in Italy, with hundreds of crew members and thousands of extras. Wyler was the overlord of the largest crew and oversaw more extras than any other film had ever used. Wyler's \"Ben-Hur\" grossed $74 million (approximately $600 million at today's ticket prices, ranking it #13 film in terms of all-time box office performance, when adjusted for inflation), the film was the fourth highest-grossing film of all-time when it was released, surpassed only by ...E o Vento Levou (1939), DeMille's Os Dez Mandamentos (1956), and Walt Disney's Branca de Neve e os Sete An\u00f5es (1937). \"Ben-Hur\" went on to win 11 Oscars out of 12 nominations, including a third Best Director Academy Award for Wyler. The 11 Oscars set a record since tied by Titanic (1997) and O Senhor dos An\u00e9is: O Retorno do Rei (2003).In the last decade of his career, he remade \"These Three\" as Inf\u00e2mia (1961), a franker version of Hellman's play than his 1936 version. O Colecionador (1965) was his last artistic triumph, and he had his last hit with Funny Girl: A Garota Genial (1968), for which Barbra Streisand repeated Audrey Hepburn's success of 15 years earlier, wining an Oscar in her first lead role. Wyler's last film was A Liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de L. B. Jones (1970), an estimable failure that tackled the theme of racial prejudice, but which came out in the revolutionary time of Sem Destino (1969) and other such films, and held little promise for such traditional warhorses as Wyler.Although he reportedly dreamed of making more pictures, Wyler's failing health kept him from taking on another film. Instead, he and his wife Margaret Tallichet, the mother of his five children, contented themselves with travel. William Wyler died on July 27, 1981, in Beverly Hills, California.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Jon C.

		{"id": 830, "artistName": "Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud", "birthPlace": "Paris, France", "birthDate": "1944-05-28", "deathDate": null, "pictureurl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM1NTA2MTQyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDQ0MzA5Ng@@._V1_.jpg", "bio": "\n\n              Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud is not everybody's cup of tea for sure, but will remain an important name in film history. As an actor he can be adored or hated for exactly the same reasons: he is one of those rare players that directors let improvise his dialogue, which gets on certain viewers' nerves while it fascinates others. The same is true for his very personal staccato diction and elocution and his many mannerisms, the most obvious one being his way to run his hand through his long hair. But there is no denying L\u00e9aud is not just another actor, whether you love him or are allergic to him. The son of actress Jacqueline Pierreux and scriptwriter/assistant director Pierre L\u00e9aud, Jean-Pierre started acting very early. Indeed, he was only thirteen when he first appeared on a screen, playing a small role in a swashbuckling film directed by veteran Georges Lampin \"la Tour, prends garde!\" (1957). And he was still only fourteen when he answered an ad placed in a newspaper by Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, who was seeking a young actor able to play Antoine Doinel, a troubled adolescent, in his first feature film \"The 400 blows\". Jean-Pierre was tested among a hundred other candidates and proved so amazingly spontaneous and so gifted for improvisation that not only was he hired but he would go on to play the role in four subsequent Truffaut semi-autobiographies concluding with \"Love on the run\" (1978), a unique experience indeed. Thanks to Truffaut he was introduced to the other stars of the French New Wave, mainly Jean-Luc Godard for whom he would appear in eight films and one TV film, and gradually became their icon. Not too sure about his acting talents, he planned to become a director (which he actually did only once) and worked as an assistant to Truffaut and Godard. But his success both as Truffaut's alter ego and as the leftist movie makers' spokesman encouraged him to go on playing rather than directing. \"Masculin F\u00e9minin\" (1966) by Godard even earned him an Award for Best Actor at the Berlin Film Festival. An ardent leftist militant himself, he worked with equally committed directors, including abroad. He was in Italian Pasolini's \"Porcile\" (1968), in Polish Skolimovski's \"Dialog 20-40-60\" (also '68) Brazilian Carlos Diegues' Os herdeiros (1970) and Glauber Rocha's Der Leone have sept cabe\u00e7as (1971). Bertolucci also hired him for \"Last tango in Paris\" starring Marlon Brando (who so petrified L\u00e9aud that he could not play his scenes alongside him), but this one was filmed in Paris. This busy period ended after an excellent role in a classic art movie in the French style: Jean Eustache's \"La maman et la putain\". In the late seventies and throughout the eighties L\u00e9aud worked irregularly, mainly on television, occasionally giving a crazy performance in a mainstream film, as was the case in Josiane's Balasko crime comedy \"Les keufs\", for which he got a C\u00e9sar nomination. But he made an exciting comeback in the nineties when several \"new New Wave\" directors hired L\u00e9aud to pay homage to their elders. Among them French movie makers such as Olivier Assayas, Dani\u00e8le Dubroux , Serge Le P\u00e9ron or Bertrand Bonello and foreigners like Finnish Aki K\u00e4urism\u00e4ki and Taiwanese Tsai Ming-Liang. A second youth for eternally young, rebellious, ill-at-ease, annoyingly romantic,touchingly annoying Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud, whose round face staring at the camera in the last shot of \"The 400 blows\" will never be forgotten.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Guy Bellinger\n          \n\n", "realName": null, "height": "170"},

In 1947, aged 15, he founded a film club and met Andr\u00e9 Bazin, a French critic, who became his protector. Bazin helped the delinquent Truffaut and also when he was put in jail because he deserted the army. In 1953 Truffaut published his first movie critiques in \"Les Cahiers du Cinema.\" In this magazine Truffaut, and some of his friends as passionate as he was, became defenders of what they call the \"author policy\". In 1954, as a test, Truffaut directed his first short film. Two years afterwords he assisted Roberto Rossellini with some later abandoned projects.The year 1957 was an important one for him: he married Madeleine Morgenstern, the daughter of an important film distributor, and founded his own production company, Les Films du Carrosse; named after Jean Renoir's A Carruagem de Ouro (1952). He also directed Os Pivetes (1957), considered the real first step of his cinematographic work. His other big year was 1959: the huge success of his first full-length film, Os Incompreendidos (1959), was the beginning of the New Wave, a new way of making movies in France. This was also the year his first daughter, Laura Truffaut, was born.From 1959 until his death, Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's life and films are mixed up. Let's only note he had two other daughters Eva Truffaut (b. 1961) and Josephine (b. 1982, with French actress Fanny Ardant). Truffaut was the most popular and successful French film director ever.

His father is from a Northern Irish Protestant background, while his mother was born in South Africa, to a Jewish family (from Lithuania, Poland, Russia, and Germany). Daniel began performing in small school productions as a young boy. Soon enough, he landed a role in David Copperfield (1999), as the young David Copperfield. A couple of years later, he landed a role as Mark Pendel in O Alfaiate do Panam\u00e1 (2001), the son of Harry and Louisa Pendel (Geoffrey Rush and Jamie Lee Curtis). Curtis had indeed pointed out to Daniel's mother that he could be Harry Potter himself. Soon afterwards, Daniel was cast as Harry Potter by director, Chris Columbus in the film that hit theaters in November 16, 2001, Harry Potter e a Pedra Filosofal (2001). He was recognized worldwide after this film was released. Pleasing audiences and critics everywhere, filming on its sequel, Harry Potter e a C\u00e2mara Secreta (2002), commenced shortly afterwards. He appeared again as Harry in Harry Potter e o Prisioneiro de Azkaban (2004) directed by Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, and then appeared in Harry Potter e o C\u00e1lice de Fogo (2005) directed by Mike Newell. Shortly afterwards, he finished filming Um Ver\u00e3o para Toda Vida (2007) in Adelaide, Australia, Kangaroo Island, and Geelong, Australia which began on the 14 November 2005 and ended sometime in December. On January 27, 2006, he attended the South Bank Awards Show to present the award for \"Breakthrough Artist of the Year\" to Billie Piper. Daniel reprised his famous character once again for the next installment of the Harry Potter series, Harry Potter e a Ordem da F\u00eanix (2007). In February 2007, he took on his first stage role in the West End play Equus, to worldwide praise from fans and critics alike. Also that year, he starred in the television movie My Boy Jack (2007), which aired on 11 November 2007 in the UK.After voicing a character in an episode of the animated television series The Simpsons in late 2010, Radcliffe debuted as J. Pierrepont Finch in the 2011 Broadway revival How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, a role previously held by Broadway veterans Robert Morse and Matthew Broderick. Other cast members included John Larroquette, Rose Hemingway and Mary Faber. Both the actor and production received good reviews, with USA Today commenting: \"Radcliffe ultimately succeeds not by overshadowing his fellow cast members, but by working in conscientious harmony with them - and having a blast in the process.\" Radcliffe's performance in the show earned him Drama Desk Award, Drama League Award and Outer Critics Circle Award nominations. The production itself later received nine Tony Award nominations. Radcliffe left the show on 1 January 2012. His first post-Harry Potter project was the 2012 horror film The Woman in Black, adapted from the 1983 novel by Susan Hill. The film was released on 3 February 2012 in the United States and Canada, and was released on 10 February in the UK. Radcliffe portrays a man sent to deal with the legal matters of a mysterious woman who has just died, and soon after he begins to experience strange events from the ghost of a woman dressed in black. He has said he was \"incredibly excited\" to be part of the film and described the script as \"beautifully written\".In 2013, he portrayed American poet Allen Ginsberg in the thriller drama Versos de um Crime (2013), directed by John Krokidas. He also starred in an Irish-Canadian romantic comedy film The F Word directed by Michael Dowseand written by Elan Mastai, based on TJ Dawe and Michael Rinaldi's play Toothpaste and Cigars and then he starred in an American dark fantasy horror film directed by Alexandre Aja Horns. Both of the films premiered at the 38th Toronto International Film Festival. Radcliffe also performed at the No\u00ebl Coward Theatre in the stage play revival of Martin McDonagh's dark comedy The Cripple of Inishmaan as the lead, Billy Claven, for which he won the WhatsOnStage Award for Best Actor in a Play. In 2015, Radcliffe starred as Igor in a science fiction horror film Victor Frankenstein (2015), directed by Paul McGuigan and written by Max Landis, which was based on contemporary adaptations of Mary Shelley's 1818 novel Frankenstein. In 2016, he appeared as a wealthy villain in the mystery/action film Truque de Mestre: O 2\u00ba Ato (2016), and as an oftentimes mobile corpse in the indie fantasy Um Cad\u00e1ver Para Sobreviver (2016).Now being one of the world's most recognizable people, Daniel leads a somewhat normal life.

She moved to Oxfordshire when she was five, where she attended the Dragon School. From the age of six, Emma knew that she wanted to be an actress and, for a number of years, she trained at the Oxford branch of Stagecoach Theatre Arts, a part-time theatre school where she studied singing, dancing and acting. By the age of ten, she had performed and taken the lead in various Stagecoach productions and school plays.In 1999, casting began for Harry Potter and the Sorcerers (2001), the film adaptation of British author J.K. Rowling's bestselling novel. Casting agents found Emma through her Oxford theatre teacher. After eight consistent auditions, producer David Heyman told Emma and fellow applicants, Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint, that they had been cast for the roles of the three leads, Hermione Granger, Harry Potter and Ron Weasley. The release of Harry Potter e a Pedra Filosofal (2001) was Emma's cinematic screen debut. The film broke records for opening-day sales and opening-weekend takings and was the highest-grossing film of 2001. Critics praised the film and the performances of the three leading young actors. The highly distributed British newspaper, 'The Daily Telegraph', called her performance \"admirable\".

He himself has noted that these early travels as a young man have had a great influence on him as a film-maker. The setting of his films have often been in the places he visited during this period.After his travels, Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu returned to Mexico City and majored in communications at Universidad Iberoamericana. In 1984, he started his career as a radio host at the Mexican radio station WFM, a rock and eclectic music station. In 1988, he became the director of the station. Over the next five years, Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu spent his time interviewing rock stars, transmitting live concerts, and making WFM the number one radio station in Mexico. From 1987 to 1989, he composed music for six Mexican feature films. He has stated that he believes music has had a bigger influence on him as an artist than film itself.In the nineties, Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu created Z films with Raul Olvera in Mexico. Under Z Films, he started writing, producing and directing short films and advertisements.

Amores perros went on to be nominated for Best Foreign Film at the Academy Awards.After the success of Amores Perros, Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu and Guillermo Arriaga revisited the intersecting story structure of Amores perros in Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's second film, 21 Grams. The film starred Benicio del Toro, Naomi Watts and Sean Penn, and was presented at the Venice Film Festival, winning the Volpi Cup for actor Sean Penn. At the 2004 Academy Awards, Del Toro and Watts received nominations for their performances.In 2005 Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu embarked on his third film, Babel, set in 4 countries on 3 continents, and in 4 different languages. Babel consists of four stories set in Morocco, Mexico, the United States, and Japan. The film stars Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett and Adriana Barraza. The majority of the rest of the cast, however, was made up of non-professional actors and some new actors, such as Rinko Kikuchi. It was presented at Cannes 2006, where Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu earned the Best Director Prize (Prix de la mise en sc\u00e8ne). Babel was released in November 2006 and received seven nominations at the 79th Annual Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu is the first Mexican director nominated for a DGA award and for an Academy Award. Babel went on to win Best Motion Picture in the drama category at the Golden Globe Awards on January 15, 2007. Gustavo Santaolalla won the Academy Award that year for Best Original Score. After Babel, Alejandro and his writing partner Guillermo Arriaga professionally parted ways, following Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu barring Arriaga from the set during filming (Arriaga told the LA Times in 2009 \"It had to come to an end, but I still respect Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu\").In 2008 and 2009, Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu directed and produced Biutiful, starring Javier Bardem, written by Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, Armando Bo, and Nicolas Giacobone.

		{"id": 848, "artistName": "Robert Sean Leonard", "birthPlace": "Westwood, New Jersey, USA", "birthDate": "1969-02-28", "deathDate": null, "pictureurl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAzMTU0OTk3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjk4NzE3._V1_.jpg", "bio": "\n\n              One actor who has deserved much acknowledgment and fame and has had to do without it on a number of occasions is Robert Sean Leonard, known by most as Dr. James Wilson on Dr. House (2004). But his career has spanned a number of classic films, alongside such greats as Daniel Day-Lewis, Christian Bale, Paul Newman, and Denzel Washington.Born Robert Lawrence Leonard in Westland, New Jersey, he attended first Fordham University and then Columbia University. Afterwards he was accepted into the Screen Actor's Guild, changing his middle name to 'Sean'. Leonard's first acting role was Meus Dois Amores (1986) where he was cast in a small role. That same year he was also in Jogos Fatais (1986). The film is a suspense thriller starring John Lithgow and is about a science experiment taken too far.Leonard continued on from these firsts and landed a role in Bluffing It (1987) and then acted in another teen comedy: Meu Doce Vampiro (1987). His next role is easily one of his most memorable. He took the second billing in Sociedade dos Poetas Mortos (1989) opposite Robin Williams and Ethan Hawke. His character of Neil Perry is a young student whose passion for acting is smothered in fear of his father's wrath and his parents' domination of his life. While Robin Williams earned himself an Oscar nomination, Leonard gave a truly Oscar-worthy performance.The 20-year old actor was well on his way now, and he proceeded to act in another Oscar-nominated film: Cenas de uma Fam\u00edlia (1990) starring Paul Newman. Leonard resumed the rebellious youth act from \"Dead Poets\" as he played one of the children caught between their father's conservative ways and their own ideas. Leonard followed up with the not-so successful Particularidades do Casamento (1991). Two years after that Leonard found massive success in three different films.Firstly, he acted in Kenneth Branagh's Muito Barulho por Nada (1993). Pulling in 60 million on an 8 million dollar budget, it remains one of the most successful films based off of a play by Shakespeare. Leonard was surrounded by other talents apart in addition to Branagh, such as Brian Blessed, Kate Beckinsale, Denzel Washington, Michael Keaton, and Emma Thompson. Leonard played the character of Claudio and was sadly criticized by several critics for his acting. However others such as Roger Ebert defended the young lead whose character is deceived into thinking his betrothed is unfaithful.In the same year, Leonard took the lead in Os \u00daltimos Rebeldes (1993), which also starred Christian Bale, Frank Whaley, Barbara Hershey and Kenneth Branagh who, rather than upstage Leonard, Bale and Whaley, refused any credit in the film. The film, another success for Leonard, told the story of a group of friends in the Hitler Youth attempting to hold onto something they love-- the Lindy hop. Reviews were mixed, but the film has a faithful following to this day.Also that year Leonard took a smaller role in Martin Scorsese's elaborate and artistic film A \u00c9poca da Inoc\u00eancia (1993) starring Daniel Day-Lewis, Winona Ryder, and Michelle Pfeiffer. The film is about the aristocrat who must choose between two women and risk scandal. The film earned Ryder an Oscar nomination and a win for Best Costume. Leonard himself played the young son of Danny Archer and plays a crucial role at the end of the film.After these three great films Leonard's career slowed down. Despite acting in three different films in 1996 (the Oliver Stone-produced Confiss\u00f5es de um Assassino (1995) starring James Woods, the light-hearted A Turma (1996), and the romantic Bem-Me-Quer, Mal-Me-Quer (1996)) none were as successful as those he made in 1993. Leonard moved onwards to act in (among other things) O Fim da Era Discoteca (1998) and the thriller P\u00e2nico no Ar (1998) opposite Kiefer Sutherland, Henry Winkler, and Bruce McGill.Leonard's work changed as the new millennium began. He turned to television as well as continuing film. He acted in the series The Outer Limits (1995) and Wasteland (1999) as well as making movies such as the dramatic film Amargo Reencontro (2001) by Richard Linklater, Vest\u00edgio do Inferno (2001) opposite James Caan, and the box office bomb Alta Velocidade (2001) starring Sylvester Stallone and Burt Reynolds. After a few more films Leonard was cast in the series that gave him much fame.Dr. House (2004) is a drama series about a cynical, antisocial, crippled doctor who is almost always correct in his solutions to medical problems. Leonard, the first actor to be cast in the series, plays the character of Dr. Wilson, the only person that House considers a friend. Wilson is a much more humane person than House, which leads to many debates between himself and House, though he is plagued by his own problems. It is the best known face that Leonard has ever portrayed in his career, and hopefully he will take on other fantastic roles and obtain the honors he so richly deserves.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Bob Stage\n          \n\n", "realName": "Robert Lawrence Leonard", "height": "183"},

He broke away easily from generations of tradition as the circus life had no appeal whatsoever to Walbrook.Trained by the legendary director Max Reinhardt, Walbrook's reputation grew on both the Austrian and German stages. In between he managed a couple of undistinguished roles in silent films. Billed as Adolf Wohlbr\u00fcck, the youthfully handsome actor graced a number of romantic films come the advent of sound beginning in 1931. Among them A Guerra das Valsas (1933) and the gender-bending comedy Viktor und Viktoria (1933), which later served as the inspiration and basis for Blake Edwards' own V\u00edtor ou Vit\u00f3ria? (1982) starring wife Julie Andrews. Hollywood beckoned in the late 30s for Walbrook to re-shoot dialog for an upcoming international picture The Soldier and the Lady (1937) again playing Michael Strogoff, a role he had played impeccably in both previous French and German adaptations. With the rise of oppression in Nazi Germany he moved to Great Britain and took his trademark mustache and dark, handsome features to English language films where he went on to appear to great effect.Portraying a host of imperious kings, bon vivants and and foreign dignitaries over the course of his career, he played everything from composer Johann Strauss to the Bavarian King Ludwig I. With a tendency for grand, intense, over-the-top acting, he was nevertheless quite impressive in a number of portrayals. Such included the sympathetic German officer in the landmark Powell and Pressburger satire Coronel Blimp: Vida e Morte (1943) and gentle pacifist in another of their collaborations Invas\u00e3o de B\u00e1rbaros (1941); as Prince Albert in the black-and-white glossy costumer A Rainha Vit\u00f3ria (1937) immediately followed by its color remake 60 Anos de Gl\u00f3rias (1938) both opposite Anna Neagle's Queen Victoria; and, most notably, as the obsessively demanding impresario opposite ballerina Moira Shearer in the romantic melodrama Os Sapatinhos Vermelhos (1948). His stiff and stern military officers were just as notable which included sterling work in A Dama de Espadas (1949) and last-speaking English film O Julgamento do Capit\u00e3o Dreyfus (1958).He retired from films at the end of the 1950s, and in later years returned to the European stage and included television roles to his resume. He died in Germany in 1967 of a heart attack.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Gary Brumburgh / gr-home@pacbell.net\n          \n\n", "realName": "Adolf Anton Wilhelm Wohlbr\u00fcck", "height": "183"},

Educated at Kings School, Canterbury and Dulwich College, he worked at the National Provincial Bank from 1922-25. In 1925 he joined Rex Ingram making Mare Nostrum (1926). He learned his craft by working at various jobs in the (then) thriving English studios of Denham and Pinewood, working his way up to director on a series of \"quota quickies\" (short films made to fulfill quota/tariff agreements between Britain and America in between the wars). Very rarely for the times, he had a true \"world view\" and, although in the mold of a classic English \"gentleman\", he was always a citizen of the world. It was therefore very fitting that he should team up with an \u00e9migr\u00e9 Hungarian Jew, Emeric Pressburger, who understood the English better than they did themselves. Between them, under the banner of \"The Archers\", they shared joint credits for an important series of films through the 1940s and '50s. Powell went on to make the controversial A Tortura do Medo (1960), a film so vilified by critics and officials alike that he didn't work in England for a very long time. He was \"re-discovered\" in the late 1960s and Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese tried to set up joint projects with him.In 1980 he lectured at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire. He was Senior Director in Residence at Coppola's Zoetrope Studios in 1981, and in fact married Scorsese's longtime editor Thelma Schoonmaker.

Around this time, Keaton decided to use an alternative surname to remove confusion with better-known actor Michael Douglas. After reading an article on actress Diane Keaton, he decided that Michael Keaton sounded good. His next break was scoring a co-starring role alongside Jim Belushi in the short-lived comedy series Working Stiffs (1979), which showcased his comedic talent and led to his co-starring role in Corretores do Amor (1982). Keaton next scored the lead in the comedy hits Mr. Mom: Dona de Casa por Acaso (1983), Johnny, o G\u00e2ngster (1984) , F\u00e1brica de Loucuras (1986), the Tim Burton horror-comedy Os Fantasmas se Divertem (1988), and De M\u00e9dico e Louco Todo Mundo Tem um Pouco (1989).Keaton's career was given another major boost when he was again cast by Tim Burton, this time as the title comic book superhero, millionaire playboy / crime-fighter Bruce Wayne, in Batman (1989). Burton cast him because he thought that Keaton was the only actor who could portray someone who has the kind of darkly obsessive personality that the character demands. To say there were howls of protest by fans of the caped crusader comic strip is an understatement! Warner Bros. was deluged with thousands of letters of complaint commenting that comedian Keaton was the wrong choice for the Caped Crusader, given his prior work and the fact that he lacked the suave, handsome features and tall, muscular physicality often attributed to the character in the comic books. However, their fears were proven wrong when Keaton turned in a sensational performance, and he held his own on screen with opponent Jack Nicholson, playing the lunatic villain, \"The Joker\". Keaton's dramatic work earned widespread acclaim from critics and audiences alike, and Batman (1989) became one of the most successful films of the year.Keaton remained active during the 1990s, appearing in a wide range of films. Keen to diversify his work, Keaton starred as a psychotic tenant in Morando com o Perigo (1990), as a hard-working cop in Justi\u00e7a Sob Tutela (1991), and then donned the black cape and cowl once more for Batman: O Retorno (1992). He remained in demand during the 1990s, appearing in a wide range of films, including the star-studded Shakespearian Muito Barulho por Nada (1993), the drama Minha Vida (1993), another Ron Howard comedy O Jornal (1994), with sexy Andie MacDowell in Eu, Minha Mulher e Minhas C\u00f3pias (1996), twice in the same role, dogged Elmore Leonard character Agent Ray Nicolette, in Jackie Brown (1997) and Irresist\u00edvel Paix\u00e3o (1998). He also played a killer in the mediocre thriller Medidas Desesperadas (1998).In the 2000s, Keaton appeared in several productions with mixed success, including Ao Vivo de Bagd\u00e1 (2002), A Filha do Presidente (2004), and Herbie, Meu Fusca Turbinado (2005). He also provided voices for characters in the animated films Carros (2006), Toy Story 3 (2010), and Minions (2015).He returned to major film roles in the 2010s, co-starring in Os Outros Caras (2010), RoboCop (2014) and Need for Speed: O Filme (2014). Also that year, Keaton starred alongside Zach Galifianakis, Edward Norton, Emma Stone, and Naomi Watts in Birdman ou (A Inesperada Virtude da Ignor\u00e2ncia) (2014), a film by 21 Gramas (2003) and Biutiful (2010) director Alejandro G. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu. In the film, Keaton plays Riggan Thomson, a screen actor, famous for playing the iconic titular superhero, who puts on a Broadway play based on a Raymond Carver short story, to regain his former glory. Keaton's critically praised lead performance earned him a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy, the Critics' Choice Award for Best Actor and Best Actor in a Comedy, and nominations for the Screen Actors Guild Award, British Academy Film Award, and Academy Award for Best Actor.In 2015, he played a journalist in Spotlight: Segredos Revelados (2015), which, like Birdman, won the Academy Award for Best Picture. In 2016, he starred as Ray Kroc, the developer of McDonald's, in the drama Fome de Poder (2016).He is a visiting scholar at Carnegie Mellon University.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            firehouse44 and Pedro Borges\n          \n\n", "realName": "Michael John Douglas", "height": "175"},

Laurence Kerr Olivier was born in Dorking, Surrey, England, to Agnes Louise (Crookenden) and Gerard Kerr Olivier, a High Anglican priest. His surname came from a great-great-grandfather who was of French Huguenot origin.One of Olivier's earliest successes as a Shakespearean actor on the London stage came in 1935 when he played \"Romeo\" and \"Mercutio\" in alternate performances of \"Romeo and Juliet\" with John Gielgud. A young Englishwoman just beginning her career on the stage fell in love with Olivier's Romeo. In 1937, she was \"Ophelia\" to his \"Hamlet\" in a special performance at Kronberg Castle, Elsinore, Denmark. In 1940, she became his second wife after both returned from making films in America that were major box office hits of 1939. His film was O Morro dos Ventos Uivantes (1939), her film was ...E o Vento Levou (1939). Vivien Leigh and Olivier were screen lovers in Fogo Por Sobre a Inglaterra (1937), 3 Semanas de Loucura (1940) and Lady Hamilton, a Divina Dama (1941).There was almost a fourth film together in 1944 when Olivier and Leigh traveled to Scotland with Charles C. Bennett to research the real-life story of a Scottish girl accused of murdering her French lover. Bennett recalled that Olivier researched the story \"with all the thoroughness of Sherlock Holmes\" and \"we unearthed evidence, never known or produced at the trial, that would most certainly have sent the young lady to the gallows\". The film project was then abandoned. During their two-decade marriage, Olivier and Leigh appeared on the stage in England and America and made films whenever they really needed to make some money.In 1951, Olivier was working on a screen adaptation of Theodore Dreiser's novel \"Sister Carrie\" (Perdi\u00e7\u00e3o por Amor (1952)) while Leigh was completing work on the film version of the Tennessee Williams' play, Uma Rua Chamada Pecado (1951). She won her second Oscar for bringing \"Blanche DuBois\" to the screen. Perdi\u00e7\u00e3o por Amor (1952) was a film that Olivier never talked about. George Hurstwood, a middle-aged married man from Chicago who tricked a young woman into leaving a younger man about to marry her, became a New York street person in the novel. Olivier played him as a somewhat nicer person who didn't fall quite as low. A PBS documentary on Olivier's career broadcast in 1987 covered his first sojourn in Hollywood in the early 1930s with his first wife, Jill Esmond, and noted that her star was higher than his at that time. On film, he was upstaged by his second wife, too, even though the list of films he made is four times as long as hers.More than half of his film credits come after Vida de Solteiro (1960), which started out as a play in London in 1957. When the play moved across the Atlantic to Broadway in 1958, the role of \"Archie Rice\"'s daughter was taken over by Joan Plowright, who was also in the film. They married soon after the release of Vida de Solteiro (1960).\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Dale O'Connor <daleoc@worldnet.att.net>\n          \n\n", "realName": "Laurence Kerr Olivier", "height": "178"},

Her father was a British patent attorney with a lucrative practice in Japan, but due to Joan and older sister Olivia de Havilland's recurring ailments the family moved to California in the hopes of improving their health. Mrs. de Havilland and the two girls settled in Saratoga while their father went back to his practice in Japan. Joan's parents did not get along well and divorced soon afterward. Mrs. de Havilland had a desire to be an actress but her dreams were curtailed when she married, but now she hoped to pass on her dream to Olivia and Joan. While Olivia pursued a stage career, Joan went back to Tokyo, where she attended the American School. In 1934 she came back to California, where her sister was already making a name for herself on the stage. Joan likewise joined a theater group in San Jose and then Los Angeles to try her luck there. After moving to L.A., Joan adopted the name of Joan Burfield because she didn't want to infringe upon Olivia, who was using the family surname. She tested at MGM and gained a small role in Adeus Mulheres (1935), but she was scarcely noticed and Joan was idle for a year and a half. During this time she roomed with Olivia, who was having much more success in films. In 1937, this time calling herself Joan Fontaine, she landed a better role as Trudy Olson in A Sorte n\u00e3o Se Compra (1937) and then an uncredited part in A Rua da Vaidade (1937). Although the next two years saw her in better roles, she still yearned for something better. In 1940 she garnered her first Academy Award nomination for Rebecca, a Mulher Inesquec\u00edvel (1940). Although she thought she should have won, (she lost out to Ginger Rogers in Kitty Foyle (1940)), she was now an established member of the Hollywood set. She would again be Oscar-nominated for her role as Lina McLaidlaw Aysgarth in Suspeita (1941), and this time she won. Joan was making one film a year but choosing her roles well. In 1942 she starred in the well-received Isto, Acima de Tudo (1942). The following year she appeared in De Amor Tamb\u00e9m Se Morre (1943). Once again she was nominated for the Oscar, she lost out to Jennifer Jones in A Can\u00e7\u00e3o de Bernadette (1943). By now it was safe to say she was more famous than her older sister and more fine films followed. In 1948, she accepted second billing to Bing Crosby in A Valsa do Imperador (1948). Joan took the year of 1949 off before coming back in 1950 with Para\u00edso Proibido (1950) and Alma Sem Pudor (1950). In 1951 she starred in Paramount's A Mulher que n\u00e3o Pecou (1951), which turned out badly for both her and the studio and more weak productions followed. Absent from the big screen for a while, she took parts in television and dinner theaters. She also starred in many well-produced Broadway plays such as Forty Carats and The Lion in Winter. Her last appearance on the big screen was A Face do Dem\u00f4nio (1966) and her final appearance before the cameras was Good King Wenceslas (1994). She is, without a doubt, a lasting movie icon.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Denny Jackson\n          \n\n", "realName": "Joan de Beauvoir de Havilland", "height": "161"},

Her notable stage works included the role of Lady Macbeth, which she played first in the 1920s, and gave an Emmy Award-winning television performance in Macbeth (1960).

She appeared in the television version of Medea (1983) in the supporting character of the Nurse.Anderson made her Hollywood film debut under director Rowland Brown in a supporting role in Blood Money (1933). Her striking, not conventionally attractive features were complemented with her powerful presence, mastery of timing and an effortless style. Anderson made a film career as a supporting character actress in several significant films including Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca, a Mulher Inesquec\u00edvel (1940), for which she was Oscar nominated for Best Supporting Actress.

Her father was a prominent advertising executive who divorced her mother when the girl was only eight years old. Her mother remarried (to an oilman) when Jan was still a youngster and the family relocated abroad where Jan was schooled by private tutors in Brazil, then later in London and Paris.Although both sets of parents disapproved, Jan, who by this time possessed a strong British accent, set her sites on acting and was eventually enrolled in Fay Compton's dramatic school in London. A strong-minded young lady with a heartfelt passion for the arts, she returned to Manhattan to conquer Broadway and by the age of 17 had found her first ing\u00e9nue role in \"Bachelor Born,\" playing (naturally) a young British lady. Over the next 11 years, Jan dominated Broadway as proper British ladies while billing herself as \"Jane Adrian\".One of her highlights was working with the legendary Ruth Gordon in 1942 in Gordon's first play entitled \"Over 21.\" As Billie Dawn in the Chicago company of \"Born Yesterday,\" Jan bowled over the critics and seemed almost a shoo-in to do the 1950 film version but she lost out in the end to Judy Holliday. The ash-blonde broke quickly into films supporting Oscar-winning Jane Wyman in Belinda (1948) in a key, emotional role.To her absolute delight, she left the docile, ladylike image behind her and was allowed to dig her nails into a florid array of cheap floozies, hard-bitten dames, and lethal schemers and stood out well with 'bad girl' parts in the films \u00c0 Margem da Vida (1950), A Montanha dos 7 Abutres (1951), Tormento da Carne (1952), No Dom\u00ednio do V\u00edcio (1954), and Frenesi de Paix\u00f5es (1955). In between she occasionally made a nicer, or at least a more sympathetic, impression in the movies C\u00e9u de Prata (1952) and Um Fio de Esperan\u00e7a (1954), the latter earning her an Oscar nomination.Married to and divorced from actor John Merivale in the 1940s, Jan later married gruff film star Paul Douglas in 1950. The couple moved away from the Hollywood scene in Burlington, Vermont. The couple appeared together professionally on occasional TV shows and Douglas revived his \"Born Yesterday\" Harry Brock role with a stage tour starring Jan in the Billie Dawn part. It and they were a solid hit.Jan's career slowed down considerably after the sudden death of her 52-year-old second husband in 1959. He suffered a massive heart attack at their Hollywood home. She refocused on stage and TV but at a slower step. Incidental filming occurred on occasion, including support roles in Esconderijo para o Amor (1961) and O Incidente (1967). She also involved herself in humanitarian causes. In the late 1960s she moved to London, England and in the 70s, she entered into a strong personal relationship with actor Sam Wanamaker. An isolated film role came her way with a small part in Um Juiz Muito Louco (1981). They never married but stayed together until his death in 1993.Inactive for nearly two decades, Jan made an appearance at the Cinecon Film Festival in Los Angeles in the fall of 2001, still charming audiences at the age of 80. On 26 March 2004, she passed away at the Motion Picture and Television Hospital in Woodland Hills, California.

His father was an Italian immigrant, and his mother's heritage is half French (from Brittany) and half German. The young Stallone attended the American College of Switzerland and the University of Miami, eventually obtaining a B.A. degree. Initially, he struggled in small parts in films such as the soft-core O Garanh\u00e3o Italiano (1970), the thriller Klute, O Passado Condena (1971) and the comedy Bananas (1971). He got a crucial career break alongside fellow young actor Henry Winkler, sharing lead billing in the effectively written teen gang film Os Lordes de Flatbush (1974). Further film and television roles followed, most of them in uninspiring productions except for the opportunity to play a megalomaniac, bloodthirsty race driver named \"Machine Gun Joe Viterbo\" in the Roger Corman-produced Corrida da Morte - Ano 2000 (1975). However, Stallone was also keen to be recognized as a screenwriter, not just an actor, and, inspired by the 1975 Muhammad Ali-Chuck Wepner fight in Cleveland, Stallone wrote a film script about a nobody fighter given the \"million to one opportunity\" to challenge for the heavyweight title. Rocky: Um Lutador (1976) became the stuff of cinematic legends, scoring ten Academy Award nominations, winning the Best Picture Award of 1976 and triggering one of the most financially successful movie franchises in history! Whilst full credit is wholly deserved by Stallone, he was duly supported by tremendous acting from fellow cast members Talia Shire, Burgess Meredith and Burt Young, and director John G. Avildsen gave the film an emotive, earthy appeal from start to finish. Stallone had truly arrived on his terms, and offers poured in from various studios eager to secure Hollywood's hottest new star.Stallone followed Rocky: Um Lutador (1976) with F.I.S.T. (1978), loosely based on the life of Teamsters boss \"Jimmy Hoffa\", and A Taberna do Inferno (1978) before pulling on the boxing gloves again to resurrect Rocky Balboa in the sequel Rocky II: A Revanche (1979). The second outing for the \"Italian Stallion\" wasn't as powerful or successful as the first \"Rocky\"; however, it still produced strong box office. Subsequent films Falc\u00f5es da Noite (1981) and Fuga Para a Vit\u00f3ria (1981) failed to ignite with audiences, so Stallone was once again lured back to familiar territory with Rocky III: O Desafio Supremo (1982) and a fearsome opponent in \"Clubber Lang\" played by muscular ex-bodyguard Mr. T. The third \"Rocky\" installment far outperformed the first sequel in box office takings, but Stallone retired his prizefighter for a couple of years as another mega-franchise was about to commence for the busy actor.The character of Green Beret \"John Rambo\" was the creation of Canadian-born writer David Morrell, and his novel was adapted to the screen with Stallone in the lead role in Rambo - Programado Para Matar (1982), also starring Richard Crenna and Brian Dennehy. The movie was a surprise hit that polarized audiences because of its commentary about the Vietnam war, which was still relatively fresh in the American public's psyche. Political viewpoints aside, the film was a worldwide smash, and a sequel soon followed with Rambo II: A Miss\u00e3o (1985), which drew even stronger criticism from several quarters owing to the film's plotline about American MIAs allegedly being held in Vietnam. But they say there is no such thing as bad publicity, and \"John Rambo's\" second adventure was a major money spinner for Stallone and cemented him as one of the top male stars of the 1980s. Riding a wave of amazing popularity, Stallone called on old sparring partner Rocky Balboa to climb back into the ring to defend American pride against a Soviet threat in the form of a towering Russian boxer named \"Ivan Drago\" played by curt Dolph Lundgren in Rocky IV (1985). The fourth outing was somewhat controversial with \"Rocky\" fans, as violence levels seemed excessive compared to previous \"Rocky\" films, especially with the savage beating suffered by Apollo Creed, played by Carl Weathers, at the hands of the unstoppable \"Siberian Express\".Stallone continued forward with a slew of macho character-themed films that met with a mixed reception from his fans. Stallone: Cobra (1986) was a clumsy mess, Falc\u00e3o, o Campe\u00e3o dos Campe\u00f5es (1987) was equally mediocre, Rambo III (1988) saw Rambo take on the Russians in Afghanistan, and cop buddy film Tango e Cash: Os Vingadores (1989) just did not quite hit the mark, although it did feature a top-notch cast and there was chemistry between Stallone and co-star Kurt Russell.Philadelphia's favorite mythical boxer moved out of the shadows for his fifth screen outing in Rocky V (1990) tackling Tommy \"Machine\" Gunn played by real-life heavyweight fighter Tommy Morrison, the great-nephew of screen legend John Wayne. Sly quickly followed with the lukewarm comedy Oscar: Minha Filha Quer Casar (1991), the painfully unfunny Pare! Sen\u00e3o Mam\u00e3e Atira (1992), the futuristic action film O Demolidor (1993), and the comic book-inspired O Juiz (1995). Interestingly, Stallone then took a departure from the gung-ho steely characters he had been portraying to stack on a few extra pounds and tackle a more dramatically challenging role in the intriguing Cop Land: A Cidade dos Tiras (1997), also starring Robert De Niro and Ray Liotta. It isn't a classic of the genre, but Cop Land: A Cidade dos Tiras (1997) certainly surprised many critics with Stallone's understated performance. Stallone then lent his vocal talents to the animated adventure story Formiguinhaz (1998), reprised the role made famous by Michael Caine in a terrible remake of O Implac\u00e1vel (2000), climbed back into a race car for Alta Velocidade (2001), and guest-starred as the \"Toymaker\" in the third chapter of the immensely popular \"Spy Kids\" film series, Pequenos Espi\u00f5es 3: Game Over (2003). Showing that age had not wearied his two most popular franchises, Stallone has most recently brought back never-say-die boxer Rocky Balboa to star in, well, what else but Rocky Balboa (2006), and Vietnam veteran Rambo IV (2008) will reappear after a 20-year hiatus to once again right wrongs in the jungles of Thailand.Love him or loathe him, Sylvester Stallone has built an enviable and highly respected career in Hollywood; plus, he has considerably influenced modern popular culture through several of his iconic film characters.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            firehouse44@hotmail.com\n          \n\n", "realName": "Sylvester Enzio Stallone", "height": "177"},

A famous and successful football star at San Diego State, he played with the Oakland Raiders and retired from the sport in 1974, in order to give full attention to his goal: to be a real actor. Weathers first played small parts in two blaxploitation flicks, Friday Foster (1975) (in which he played \"Yarbro\") and Bucktown (1975) (playing \"Hambone\"), both made in 1975 and directed by Arthur Marks. However, his big break came the following year when producers Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff chose him to play \"Apollo Creed\" in the blockbuster \"sleeper\" Rocky: Um Lutador (1976) (real-life boxing legend Ken Norton was originally signed for the part, but it eventually went to Weathers). He went on to play \"Creed\" in three other \"Rocky\" movies, and the characters' adversarial relationship eventually evolved into a warm friendship. After Creed's death in Rocky IV (1985), Weathers met with producer Joel Silver and agreed to play an important supporting role in O Predador (1987), an action film starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. The following year, Silver produced Action Jackson (1988), a first starring role for Weathers, but it performed poorly at the box office and was panned by the critics. During the 1990s, Weathers starred in four In the Heat of the Night (1988) two-hour TV specials that were much better received by critics and viewers alike. In 1996, he played the part of \"Chubbs Peterson\" in the blockbuster Adam Sandler comedy Um Maluco no Golfe (1996). He returned to his \"action roots\" in two TV-movies with Hulk Hogan: Assault on Devil's Island (1997) and Guerreiros das Sombras II: A Montanha do Diabo (1999).

The family had a rich heritage in the St. Louis area: her great-great-great-grandfather served in the American Revolution and later founded the city of East Saint Louis, Illinois, located right across the Mississippi River from its namesake. Virginia was interested in show business from an early age. Her aunt operated a dance studio and Virginia began taking lessons at the age of six. After graduating from high school in 1937, she became a member of the St. Louis Municipal Opera before she was signed to a contract by Samuel Goldwyn after being spotted by an MGM talent scout during a Broadway revue. David O. Selznick gave her a screen test, but decided she wouldn't fit into films. Goldwyn, however, believed that her talent as an actress was there and cast her in a small role in 1943's Jack London (1943). She later had a walk-on part in Follies Girl (1943) that same year. Believing there was more to her than her obvious ravishing beauty, producers thought it was time to give her bigger and better roles. In 1944 she was cast as Princess Margaret in A Princesa e o Pirata (1944), with Bob Hope and a year later appeared as Ellen Shavley in Um Rapaz do Outro Mundo (1945). Her popularity increasing with every appearance, Virginia was cast in two more films in 1946, Um Tigre Domesticado (1946), with Danny Kaye, and Os Melhores Anos de Nossa Vida (1946), with Dana Andrews, and received good notices as Andrews' avaricious, unfaithful wife. Her roles may have been coming in slow, but with each one her popularity with audiences rose. She finally struck paydirt in 1947 with a plum assignment in the well-received O Homem de 8 Vidas (1947) as Rosalind van Hoorn. That same year she married Michael O'Shea and would remain with him until his death in 1973 (the union produced a daughter, Mary Catherine, in 1953). She got some of the best reviews of her career in James Cagney's return to the gangster genre, F\u00faria Sanguin\u00e1ria (1949), as Verna, the scheming, cheating wife of homicidal killer Cody Jarrett (Cagney). The striking beauty had still more plum roles in the 1950s. Parts in Algu\u00e9m Deixou Este Mundo (1950), She's Working Her Way Through College (1952) and Furac\u00e3o de Emo\u00e7\u00f5es (1953) all showed she was still a force to be reckoned with. As the decade ended, Virginia's career began to slow down. She had four roles in the 1960s and four more in the following decade. Her last role was as Lucia in 1997's The Man Next Door.

He took part in student theatrics in high school and majored in drama at Fordham University, dropping out after six months. He made his Broadway debut at the age of 21 in 1936 and, later that year, played \"The Gravedigger\" in the great Shakespearean actor John Gielgud's legendary production of \"Hamlet\". Four years later, he would play \"Mercutio\" to the \"Romeo\" of another legendary Shakespearean, Laurence Olivier, in Olivier's 1940 Brodway production of \"Romeo & Juliet\".O'Brien worked with another magician, Orson Welles, in the Mercury Theater's production of \"Julius Caesar\", appearing as \"Mark Antony\". He would later play \"Casca\" in Joseph L. Mankiewicz's film of the play, J\u00falio C\u00e9sar (1953).Altough it has been stated that he made his debut as an uncredited extra in the 1938 film, O Ex-Presidi\u00e1rio (1938), the truth is that his stage work impressed RKO boss Pandro S. Berman, who brought him to Hollywood to appear in the plum supporting part of \"Gringoire\" in O Corcunda de Notre Dame (1939), which starred Charles Laughton in the title role. After returning from his wartime service with the Army Air Force, O'Brien built up a distinguished career as a supporting actor in A-list films, and as an occasional character lead, such as in Com as Horas Contadas (1949).O'Brien won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in A Condessa Descal\u00e7a (1954) and also received a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his role as a drunken senator who ferrets out an attempted coup d'etat in Sete Dias de Maio (1964).

Increasingly, O'Brien appeared on television in the 1960s and '70s, but managed a turn in his old boss Welles' unfinished film, O Outro Lado do Vento (2018).He married and divorced actresses Nancy Kelly and Olga San Juan, the latter being the mother of his three children, including actors Maria O'Brien and Brendan O'Brien.

Walsh was also an actor: He appeared in the first version of W. Somerset Maugham's \"Rain\" renamed Sedu\u00e7\u00e3o do Pecado (1928) opposite Gloria Swanson in the title role. He would have played the Cisco Kid in his own film No Velho Arizona (1928) if an errant jackrabbit hadn't cost him his right eye by leaping through the windshield of his automobile. Warner Baxter filled the role and won an Oscar. Before John Ford and Nicholas Ray, it was Raoul Walsh who made the eye-patch almost as synonymous with a Hollywood director as Cecil B. DeMille's jodhpurs.He interned with the best, serving as assistant director and editor on D.W. Griffith's racist masterpiece, The Clansman, better known as O Nascimento de Uma Na\u00e7\u00e3o (1915), a blockbuster that may have been the highest-grossing film of all time if accurate box office records had been kept before the sound era. He pulled triple duty on that picture, playing John Wilkes Booth, the man who assassinated President Abraham Lincoln at Ford's Theater and ranked as the most notorious American actor of all time until Pee Wee Herman (Paul Reubens).The year before The Clansman, Walsh was second unit director on The Life of General Villa (1914), also playing the Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa as a young man. Walsh got his start in the business as co-director of another Pancho Villa flick, The Life of General Villa (1914), in 1912. The movie featured footage shot of an actually battle between Villa's forces and Mexican federal troops.In 1915, in addition to helping out the great Griffith, Walsh directed no less than 14 films, including his first feature-length film, Regenera\u00e7\u00e3o (1915), which he also wrote. The movie starred silent cinema superstar Anna Q. Nilsson as a society woman turned social worker who aids the regeneration of a Bowery gang leader. It was a melodrama, but an effective one. In his autobiography, Walsh credited D.W. Griffith with teaching him about the art of filmmaking and about production management techniques. The film is memorable for its shots of New York City, where Walsh had been born 28 years earlier on March 11, 1887.Raoul Walsh would continue to be a top director for 40 years and would not hang up his director's megaphone (if he still had one at that late in the game) until 1964. As a writer, his last script was made in 1970, meaning his career as a whole spanned seven decades and 58 years.He introduced the world to John Wayne in A Grande Jornada (1930) in 70mm wide-screen in 1930. It would take nine more years and John Ford to make the Duke a star. In one three-year period at Warner Bros., he directed Her\u00f3is Esquecidos (1939), Dentro da Noite (1940), Seu \u00daltimo Ref\u00fagio (1941), Uma Loira com A\u00e7\u00facar (1941), Aquela Mulher! (1941), O Intr\u00e9pido General Custer (1941), and O \u00cddolo do P\u00fablico (1942), among other films in that time frame. He helped consolidate the stardom of Humphrey Bogart and Errol Flynn while directing the great James Cagney in one of his more delightful films, Uma Loira com A\u00e7\u00facar (1941). This was the same director that would elicit Cagney's most searing performance since Inimigo P\u00fablico (1931) in the crime classic F\u00faria Sanguin\u00e1ria (1949).Novelist Norman Mailer says that Walsh was dragged off of his death bed to direct the underrated film adaptation of Mailer's A Morte Tem Seu Pre\u00e7o (1958). The movie is as masculine and unsentimental as the book, an exceedingly harsh look at the power relations between men at war on the same side that includes the attempted murder of prisoners of war and the \"fragging\" of officers (Sergeant Croft allows his lieutenant to walk into an ambush). Walsh was at his best when directing men in war or action pictures.Raoul Walsh seemingly recovered from Mailer's phantasmagorical death bed, as he lived another 22 years after A Morte Tem Seu Pre\u00e7o (1958). He died on December 31, 1980, in Simi Valley, California, at the age of 93.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Jon C.

He is the youngest of three sons born to Helen (Gabler) and Jack Crystal. His father was a well-known concert promoter who co-founded Commodore Records and his mother was a homemaker. His family were Jewish immigrants from Russia, Austria, and Lithuania. With his father in the music business, Billy was no stranger to some of the top performers of the time. Legends such as Billie Holiday, Pee Wee Russell, and Eddie Condon regularly stopped by the Crystal household. At age 15, Billy faced a personal tragedy when his father died of a heart attack at the relatively young age of 54. This gave Billy a real appreciation of what his dad was able to accomplish while alive and what his mother did to keep the family together. Despite this tragedy, Billy was very upbeat and likable as a kid. He had a unique talent for making people laugh. With television becoming a new medium, Billy got his influence from shows like The Honeymooners (1955), and \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" and performers like Alan King, Ernie Kovacs and Jonathan Winters. He started doing stand-up comedy at the age of 16. However, his real dream was to be a professional baseball player. His idol growing up was Yankees outfielder Mickey Mantle. He spent long hours in the summers playing softball in the middle of Park Avenue with his brothers and his father, a former pitcher at St. John's University . At Long Beach High, Billy played second base and was varsity captain in his senior year. This earned him a baseball scholarship from Marshall University in West Virginia which he accepted. However, he would never end up playing a game as the baseball program was suspended during his freshman year. This would lead him to leave the university and move back to New York. He then enrolled at nearby Nassau Community College, majoring in theater. It was there that he met and fell in love with a dancer named Janice Goldfinger. They would get married in 1970 and have two daughters. Shortly after, Billy got accepted in New York University, where he majored in Film and TV Direction. While at NYU, he studied under legendary filmmaker Martin Scorsese. He also worked as house manager and usher on a production of \"You're A Good Man, Charlie Brown\". After receiving a Bachelor of Fine Arts from NYU in 1970, Billy temporarily worked as a substitute teacher until he was able to get gigs as a stand-up comic. He formed his own improv group, 3's Company, and opened for musicians like Barry Manilow. His impression of Howard Cosell interviewing Muhammad Ali became a huge hit with the audience. He left Long Beach for Hollywood in August of 1976 in the hopes of trying to land a role on a television series. It only took a year before he got his big break when he was chosen for the role of gay character Jodie Dallas on the controversial ABC sitcom Soap (1977). This would be the first time that an American TV show would feature an openly gay character as a regular. The show ran successfully for four seasons and helped to jump-start Billy's previously stagnant career. After Soap (1977) ended in 1981, Billy continued to do his stand-up routine, which was now attracting a larger audience with his growing celebrity status. During this time, he made many TV guest appearances and even hosted his own short-lived variety show, The Billy Crystal Comedy Hour (1982). He became a regular on Saturday Night Live (1975) in 1984 where his Fernando Lamas impression with the catchphrase \"You Look Mahvellous\" was a huge hit with viewers. This would lead to appearances in feature-length films such as Dois Policiais em Apuros (1986) and Joga a Mam\u00e3e do Trem (1987). In 1986, along with Whoopi Goldberg and Robin Williams, he started Comic Relief, an annual stand-up comedy show which helped to raise money for housing and medical care for the homeless. The show has since grown substantially with the continued support of all three comics. Billy's career would peak in the late 1980s and early 1990s. His roles in the blockbuster movies Harry e Sally: Feitos um para o Outro (1989) and Amigos, Sempre Amigos (1991) helped to establish himself as one of Hollwood's top movie stars. This star status was further validated when he was chosen to host the annual Oscars in 1990, an honor in which he would repeat seven more times. He made his big screen directorial debut in the 1992 film Mr. Saturday Night - A Arte de Fazer Rir (1992), which was about a washed-up stand-up comic who refuses to retire. He also wrote, produced and starred in the film. Although the film was not a huge hit, it proved that Billy was much more than an actor and comedian. In the following years, Billy continued to act in, produce, and direct several films. He had his share of hits (M\u00e1fia no Div\u00e3 (1999), Os Queridinhos da Am\u00e9rica (2001)) and some flops (1 Dia 2 Pais (1997), Meu Gigante Preferido (1998)). His role in as a therapist to mobster Robert De Niro in M\u00e1fia no Div\u00e3 (1999) earned him critical praise. In 2001, Billy parlayed his childhood love of baseball and Mickey Mantle into a feature film. The movie, A Hist\u00f3ria De Um Recorde (2001), which premiered on HBO, centered on the relationship between Mantle and Roger Maris and their 1961 pursuit of Babe Ruth's home run record. The film for which Billy served as director and executive producer, garnered 12 Emmy nominations in all. Offscreen, Billy remains married to Janice Crystal and they have homes in California and New York. Both of his daughters are involved in the film business. Jennifer Crystal Foley is an aspiring actress, appearing in A Hist\u00f3ria De Um Recorde (2001), while Lindsay Crystal is an aspiring filmmaker, creating and directing the documentary My Uncle Berns (2003).\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            SteveG\n          \n\n", "realName": "William Edward Crystal", "height": "170"},

The family moved to the United States when she was three. As Claudette grew up, she wanted nothing more than to play to Broadway audiences (in those days, any actress or actor worth their salt went for Broadway, not Hollywood). After her formal education ended, she enrolled in the Art Students League, where she paid for her dramatic training by working in a dress shop. She made her Broadway debut in 1923 in the stage production of \"The Wild Wescotts\". It was during this event that she adopted the name Claudette Colbert.When the Great Depression shut down most of the theaters, Claudette decided to make a go of it in films. Her first film was called Filhos da Fortuna (1927). Unfortunately, it was a box-office disaster. She wasn't real keen on the film industry, but with an extreme scarcity in theatrical roles, she had no choice but to remain. In 1929 she starred as Joyce Roamer in Mentiras de Mulher (1929). The film was a success and later that year she had another hit entitled Grilh\u00e3o Eterno (1929). In 1930 she starred opposite Fredric March in Homicida (1930), which was a remake of the silent version of eight years earlier. A year after that Claudette was again paired in a film with March, Honra de Amantes (1931). It fared well at the box-office, probably only because it was the kind of film that catered to women who enjoyed magazine fiction romantic stories. In 1932 Claudette played the evil Poppeia in Cecil B. DeMille's last great work, O Sinal da Cruz (1932), and once again was cast with March. Later the same year she was paired with Jimmy Durante in O Falso Presidente (1932). By now Claudette's name symbolized good movies and she, along with March, pulled crowds into the theaters with the acclaimed Esta Noite \u00e9 Nossa (1933).The next year started a little on the slow side with the release of Mulheres e Homens (1934), where Claudette and her co-stars were at odds with the dreaded bubonic plague on board a ship. However, the next two films were real gems for this young actress. First up, Claudette was charming and radiant in Cecil B. DeMille's spectacular Cle\u00f3patra (1934). It wasn't one of DeMille's finest by any means, but it was a financial success and showcased Claudette as never before. However, it was as Ellie Andrews, in the now famous Aconteceu Naquela Noite (1934), that ensured she would be forever immortalized. Paired with Clark Gable, the madcap comedy was a mega-hit all across the country. It also resulted in Claudette being nominated for and winning the Oscar that year for Best Actress. IN 1935 she was nominated again for Mundos \u00cdntimos (1935), where she played Dr. Jane Everest, on the staff at a mental institution. The performance was exquisite. Films such as O L\u00edrio Dourado (1935), Ao Rufar dos Tambores (1939) and Sem Tempo Para Amar (1943) kept fans coming to the theaters and the movie moguls happy. Claudette was a sure drawing card for virtually any film she was in. In 1944 she starred as Anne Hilton in Desde Que Partiste (1944). Again, although she didn't win, Claudette picked up her third nomination for Best Actress.By the late 1940s and early 1950s she was not only seen on the screen but the infant medium of television, where she appeared in a number of programs. However, her drawing power was fading somewhat as new stars replaced the older ones. In 1955 she filmed the western O Drama de uma Consci\u00eancia (1955) and wasn't seen on the screen again until No Vale das Grandes Batalhas (1961). It was her final silver screen performance. Her final appearance before the cameras was in a TV movie, The Two Mrs. Grenvilles (1987). She did, however, remain on the stage where she had returned in 1956, her first love. After a series of strokes, Claudette divided her time between New York and Barbados. On July 30, 1996, Claudette died in Speightstown, Barbados. She was 92.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Denny Jackson\n          \n\n", "realName": "Emilie Claudette Chauchoin", "height": "164"},

While his film career, save a couple of silents, lasted a paltry seven years (1932-1939), character actor Walter Connolly certainly ran the distance. While some film historians complain that a number of his performances were annoying or overbaked, he was for the most part applauded for his zesty contributions to a number of comedy classics. Frank Capra's Dama por um Dia (1933), A Vit\u00f3ria Ser\u00e1 Tua (1934) and Aconteceu Naquela Noite (1934), not to mention the Carole Lombard/Fredric March screwball farce Nada \u00e9 Sagrado (1937) as news reporter March's hot-headed editor boss are sure-fire examples.The Cincinnati, Ohio native was born on April 8, 1887 and schooled there. The son of the head of the Western Union relay office, he attended St. Xavier College and the University of Dublin in Ireland before making his New York debut in 1910 in an outdoor presentation of \"As You Like It\". For the next year or so he was a member of E.H. Sothern's touring company and played supporting roles in a number of Shakespearean shows on the road. After a few silent pictures left him unimpressed with film-making, he turned to the Broadway stage in the 1920s and scored quite well. Somewhat short and tubby, it was not difficult for the jowly, mustachioed actor to seize laughs and he found his share in such outings as \"The Talking Parrot\" (1923), \"Applesauce\" (1925), \"The Springboard\" (1927), \"The Happy Husband\" (1928), \"Stepping Out\" (1929), \"Your Uncle Dudley\" (1930), \"Anatol\" (1931), \"Six Characters in Search of an Author\" (1931), \"The Good Fairy\" (1932) and \"The Late Christopher Bean\" (1932).With his talents as a stage farceur firmly established, it was time to make a second attempt at a film career and Hollywood (specifically, Columbia) wisely opened their doors to him. Interestingly, his debut in a full-length talking picture came at age 45 in the form of a drama, Washington Merry-Go-Round (1932), where he was third-billed as a rather benign senator. For the next seven years Connolly, often playing older than he really was, could be found everywhere giving good fluster to the greatest and glossiest of stars -- Janet Gaynor, Carole Lombard, Clark Gable, Jean Harlow, Myrna Loy, Paul Muni, Spencer Tracy, and Ginger Rogers, among hordes of others.Every now and then he was asked to hold up a film, as with his leading roles in the drama Quando os Deuses Desfazem (1934), the Hecht/MacArthur comedy/drama Soak the Rich (1936), and the whodunnits Prisioneiro de Deus (1934) (as the title priest/gumshoe) and A Liga dos Amea\u00e7ados (1937) (as supersleuth Nero Wolfe). Connolly's archetypal fuming was on full display in the comedies A Dan\u00e7a dos Ricos (1935) with George Raft and Joan Bennett and A Garota da Quinta Avenida (1939) with Ginger Rogers. His last role was as the great composer himself in the highly fictional Sonho Maravilhoso (1939), although it wasn't the leading role.Connolly married actress Nedda Harrigan in 1920. The two appeared together in the Broadway comedies \"Treat 'Em Rough\" (1926) and \"Merry Andrew\" (1929). They had one daughter, actress Ann Connolly (1924-2006), who also appeared on stage and played the grownup Wendy in the 'Mary Martin' /Cyril Ritchard Broadway production of \"Peter Pan\" in 1954. Ironically, Connolly, whose obesity was probably a contributing factor to his fatal stroke suffered on May 28, 1940, received his final divorce decree on the day he died. He was only 53.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Gary Brumburgh / gr-home@pacbell.net\n          \n\n", "realName": null, "height": "175"},

An actor who took to film direction after almost a decade in front of the camera, Ashutosh has acted in Hindi films, Marathi films, television serials and commercials and although the transition from acting to direction was difficult, it was destined.His diverse exposure as an actor whetted his appetite to helm a project, taking on the directorial reign for the first time with Pehla Nasha (First Love), a murder mystery in 1993. Though the film did not do very well at the box office, it helped Ashutosh find firm ground as a director. He followed this up with Baazi (The Game), a thriller, in 1995, which enjoyed average success, but led Ashutosh on a journey in search of a better script.With Lagaan, which released in 2001, Ashutosh veered away from most norms in the making of a mainstream commercial Hindi film - a period drama, set in rural India; it's language a dialect; most of its characters were dressed in loincloths; it included a British cast; it was a musical, and a sports film put together! It was produced by Aamir Khan who also starred in it. Lagaan was nominated at the Academy Awards in the Best Film in a Foreign Language category for 2001 and earned plaudits worldwide for its meticulous execution and evocative performances.His fourth feature film, Swades, was written, produced and directed by him, starring Shah Rukh Khan. The film released worldwide in 2004 to critical acclaim and attained huge success at the international box office.February 2008 saw the release of his most ambitious magnum opus Jodhaa Akbar, an epic romance. This brought together two of the most respected actors, Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. The film won the Best Foreign Film in the International Film Festival of Sao Paulo in Brazil, South America and the Grand Prix Best Film and Best Actor in the International Film Festival Golden Minbar in Kazan, Russia, as well as sweeping all of the Indian Film Awards.His next film saw him take on a new genre with What's Your Raashee?, being Ashutosh's first romantic comedy, based on the Gujarati novel Kimball Ravenswood by Madhu Rye. The film featured Harman Baweja and Priyanka Chopra.Khelein Hum Jee Jaan Sey is a period thriller starring Abhishek Bachchan and Deepika Padukone, based on the book 'DO and DIE: The Chittagong Uprising 1930-34' by Manini Chatterjee.His last release, Mohenjo Daro, set in the Indus Valley Civilization stars Hrithik Roshan and debutant Pooja Hegde along with a stellar supporting cast including Kabir Bedi and Arunoday Singh.Ashutosh has now engaged in the filming of his newest magnum opus Panipat, which is slated to release on December 6th, 2019. Based on the legendary third battle of Panipat, which took place on 14th January 1761 between the Marathas and King of Afghanistan, Panipat promises to be his grandest outing yet.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Ashutosh Gowariker Productions\n          \n\n", "realName": null, "height": null},

Beyond that between 2002-05, he was largely out of work, and lived in a flat he shared with four other people, and survived by conducting occasional acting workshops.

He was born and raised in Beckley, West Virginia. His mother, Cliffie (Cardullias), was born in Norfolk, Virginia, to Greek immigrants, and his father, Christopher Sarandon, a restaurateur, was born in Istanbul, Turkey, of Greek descent (the family surname was originally \"Sarondonethes\"). As a teen, Chris appeared on the musical stage and played drums and sang back-up with a local band called The Teen Tones. Graduating from Woodrow Wilson High School in 1960, his band was so good they found themselves touring and backing up such music legends as Bobby Darin, Gene Vincent and Danny and the Juniors. Chris attended West Virginia University majoring in speech, and appeared in such musical productions as \"The Music Man\" as Harold Hill. He went on to attend the Catholic University of America in Washington, DC, where he received his master's degree in theater and met first wife Susan Sarandon. Touring with improv companies and in regional theater productions, he made his professional debut in \"The Rose Tattoo\" in 1965 and later joined the Long Wharf Theatre Company for a season. Moving to New York in 1968, the dark and handsome charmer immediately nabbed the role of Dr. Tom Halverson on The Guiding Light (1952), a part that would last two years. Throughout the 1970s he would be rewarded with rich theater acting roles. On Broadway he appeared in \"The Rothchilds\" and replaced Raul Julia in \"Two Gentlemen from Verona\" while appearing elsewhere in various Shakespeare and Shaw festivals both here and in Canada. He made an auspicious film debut in the huge, career-risking part of Al Pacino's tormented, gender-confused lover in Um Dia de C\u00e3o (1975), earning an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his superior work. He took other sordid turns too, this time in co-leads, opposite the late Margaux Hemingway in the poorly done exploitative thriller A Violentada (1976) and as a demon in the shocker A Sentinela dos Malditos (1977). To avoid being typed as creepy characters, Chris extended himself brilliantly in the years to come, portraying the title role in The Day Christ Died (1980), a critically heralded TV-movie. He received high marks also for his Sydney Carton in A Tale of Two Cities (1980) and co-starred with Goldie Hawn in the more mainstream Trapalhadas na Casa Branca (1984). In the 1980s Chris would endear himself to a younger generation of filmgoers as the undeniably sexy, hypnotic vampire-next-door in the teen horror classic A Hora do Espanto (1985), the cruel, evil-plotting prince in Rob Reiner's A Princesa Prometida (1987) and as the investigating cop in Brinquedo Assassino (1988), the first in the \"Chucky\" series about a murdering doll. In recent years Chris has continued steadily on stage, film and TV but at a lesser pace and in less flashy, high-profiled roles. Divorced from Susan Sarandon in 1979, he was married and divorced from model Lisa Ann Cooper during the 1980s. In 1991 he co-starred on Broadway in the short-lived musical \"Nick and Nora\" with Joanna Gleason, the daughter of Monty Hall (Let's Make a Deal (1963)). They married in 1994 and reunited on stage in \"Thorn & Bloom\" in 1998. They have also appeared together in a number of films, including American Perfekt (1997), Edie & Pen (1996) and A Morte se Veste de Negro (1999).\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Gary Brumburgh / gr-home@pacbell.net\n          \n\n", "realName": "Christopher Sarandon", "height": "185"},

She also has two younger twin sisters, Jocelyn and Paige Howard (also an actress), born in 1985, and a brother, Reed Howard, born in 1987.

During most of her childhood, she really did not have much access to a TV. She attended Greenwich Country Day School, and Byram Hills High School in Armonk, New York. At that time, she discovered existentialism and devoured books by Albert Camus and Jean-Paul Sartre. She attended the prestigious Steppenwolf School and Stagedoor Manor Performing Arts camp at Catskills, together with her friend, Natalie Portman.

At that time, she performed in Broadway productions of classical plays by George Bernard Shaw, William Shakespeare and Anton Chekhov.Young Howard appeared in three of her father's films as an extra, including her appearance as a child together with her mother in Apollo 13: Do Desastre ao Triunfo (1995).

(Hall) and Dudley T. Ross. Her father, who also worked for the Associated Press, was away in the US Navy when she was born. His navy career shuttled the family around to Virginia, then Palo Alto, and finally to Walnut Creek, outside of San Francisco, where Ross grew up. Katharine's ancestry includes Scottish, German, Channel Islander (Guernsey), and English.Ross graduated from Las Lomas High School in Walnut Creek in 1957 and attended Diablo Valley College in the Bay Area, where she took part in her first onscreen work in a student film. Moving to San Francisco, into an apartment on Stockton Street above a grocery store, she began her acting career as an understudy in Actor's Workshop productions, and was soon auditioning for roles.Work came quickly for Ross, at first mainly in television westerns, and indeed Westerns would make up the majority of her best-known work, her natural beauty being a strong asset in that genre. Her first film role was in the Civil War era Shenandoah (1965) starring James Stewart. Ross's career as a leading actress began in earnest in 1967, with her strong turn co-starring with James Caan and Simone Signoret in O Terceiro Tiro (1967), and with A Primeira Noite de um Homem (1967). Ross's performance as Elaine earned her a Supporting Actress Oscar nomination.A disappointing, formulaic John Wayne vehicle, Her\u00f3is do Inferno (1968), followed but she soon returned to form with two films with Robert Redford. As Etta Place in Butch Cassidy (1969), Ross was part of the most memorable scene from that hit film, precariously perched barefoot on the bumper of that newfangled contraption, the bicycle, as Paul Newman's Butch Cassidy takes her for a ride. The compelling Willie Boy (1969) was less of a box office success but more highly regarded by the critics, and Ross won a BAFTA Award for her work as Lola, a Paiute Indian who flees with her boyfriend, played by Robert Blake, after he kills her father in self-defense.Swept up into a whirlwind of fame, widely idealized as the symbol of beauty for the Woodstock generation, Ross had accomplished so much so quickly that it seemed her entire career had happened almost all at once, in that frenzy of activity between 1967 and 1969. Sure enough, there followed a long dry spell in which she was mostly cast in forgettable roles; her next strong film wasn't for another six years. In As Esposas de Stepford (1975), an intriguing black comedy-cum-horror film, Ross plays a independent, free-spirited wife newly relocated to a suburb where the other wives all seem to be just a little too perfect, too submissive; it was arguably her strongest performance to date, but Stepford Wives would prove to be but a temporary resurgence for Ross, and her work in the decade and a half to follow would include such star-studded duds as Os Desalmados (1978), and a return to TV, including a part in primetime soap opera The Colbys (1985). Along the way, however, Ross found love. After four failed marriages to Joel Fabiani, John Marion, Conrad L. Hall and Gaetano Lisi, she met her present husband Sam Elliott, while working on Convite \u00e0 Morte (1978). The two actors married in 1984, and in the same year had a daughter, Cleo.In 1991, Ross and Elliott adapted the Louis L'Amour novel, O Aventureiro do Oeste (1991), for television in a remarkably affecting Western tale which showcases both actors' remarkable talents. Ross continues to take roles on occasion and, as usual, her work is strong -- something that was sometimes overlooked in her youth due to her famous beauty. For instance, Ross turned up in Donnie Darko (2001), in a solid performance as Donnie's psychiatrist.Ross and Elliott live on their ranchito in Malibu.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Larry-115\n          \n\n", "realName": "Katharine Juliet Ross", "height": "160"},

Born in 1939 in Los Angeles, he lived there in his early years before moving with his family to Los Angeles' Watts district. He showed early promise as a student at Manual Arts High School, earning distinction with several performance awards. As a senior, he earned his first professional acting job and extended his theatrical education with a two-year scholarship to the University of Portland in Oregon. Subsequent scholarships led to his studies at Stanford and Los Angeles City College, among other colleges. He left U.C.L.A. just six credits short of his Bachelor's degree.Paul's first big break came in 1964 when actor/director Burgess Meredith gave him a role in Le Roi Jones' controversial one-act play \"The Dutchman and the Toilet\". Director Meredith cast him again four years in \"The Latent Heterosexual\" with Zero Mostel. Although he won a contract at Columbia Pictures in 1966 and built up his on-camera career with a succession of television credits, he continued to focus on the legitimate stage. A member of the Stanford Repertory Theatre, he concentrated on both classic and contemporary plays. In 1969, Paul joined the Inner City Cultural Center Theatre in Los Angeles for two years, which offered a drama program for high school students.In the late 1960s, Paul redirected himself back to performing on television and in films with guest work in more than 40 series on the small screen, including a boyfriend role on the first season of the landmark black sitcom Julia (1968) starring Diahann Carroll. In films, he was given a featured role in the Sidney Poitier film Com os Minutos Contados (1969), and earned comparable roles in R.P.M.: Revolu\u00e7\u00f5es por Minuto (1970) and O Estranho John Kane (1971) before major stardom occurred. 1972 proved to be a banner year for Paul after winning the male lead opposite Cicely Tyson in the touching classic film L\u00e1grimas de Esperan\u00e7a (1972). His towering performance as a sharecropper who is imprisoned and tortured for stealing a ham for his impoverished family earned him an Oscar nomination for \"Best Actor\" -- the third black actor (Sidney Poitier and James Earl Jones preceded him) to receive such an honor at the time.From there a host of films and quality television roles began arriving on his doorstep. In minimovies, Paul portrayed various historical/entertainment giants including Thurgood Marshall, Don King and baseball's Roy Campanella, and was Emmy-nominated for his portrayal of Martin Luther King, Jr. in King (1978) with Sounder co-star Cicely Tyson as wife Coretta. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, he earned solid distinction in such prestige projects as Backstairs at the White House (1979), Roots: The Next Generations (1979) (another Emmy nomination), The Sophisticated Gents (1981), The Blue and the Gray (1982), Sister, Sister (1982), James Baldwin's American Playhouse: Go Tell It on the Mountain (1985), Terrorismo em Washington (1986) and The Women of Brewster Place (1989). Although the big screen did not offer the same consistent quality following his breakthrough with Sounder, he nevertheless turned in strong roles in Conrack (1974), Huckleberry Finn (1974), A Hero Ain't Nothin' But a Sandwich (1978) (again with Ms. Tyson), Heran\u00e7a Nuclear (1977), Jornada nas Estrelas II: A Ira de Khan (1982) and C\u00e3o Branco (1982).Paul never achieved the promise of a Sidney Poitier-like stardom and his roles diminished in size. Relegated to character roles, he still appeared in such quality television as Breathing Lessons (1994), although he was not the major focus. After two nominations, he finally won the Emmy for a guest performance as a judge on Picket Fences (1992). Paul's showier work at this period of time included the film Catfish in Black Bean Sauce (1999) and a surprise cross-dressing cameo as Aunt Matilda in Relax... It's Just Sex (1998). On stage, he graced such productions as \"Richard III\" (at New York's Lincoln Center Theatre), \"Othello\", \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\", \"The Seagull\", \"A Few Good Men\", \"Happy Endings\" and \"Checkmates\", which became his sole Broadway credit. Paul also served as Artist in Residence at the University of Hawaii and subsequently at the University of California at Santa Barbara. In his final years, he narrated the A&E crime series City Confidential (1998), appeared as a teacher in a television adaptation of his earlier success O Maravilhoso Mundo de Disney: Sounder (2003), and enjoyed a recurring role as Sam for many years on the series O Toque de um Anjo (1994).Suffering from obesity and diabetes in later life, Paul Winfield passed away from a heart attack at age 64 in 2004, and was survived by a sister, Patricia. His longtime companion of 30 years, set designer and architect Charles Gillan Jr. predeceased him by two years.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Gary Brumburgh / gr-home@pacbell\n          \n\n", "realName": "Paul Edward Winfield", "height": "188"},

Lived in Lexington, Kentucky and graduated from Lafayette Senior High School with the class of 1944. Drafted into the Navy, he served as a cook in the U.S. Navy during World War II, and was on board an LST during the Battle of Okinawa. He then returned to the University of Kentucky to appear in a production of \"Pygmalion\", before heading out to California and honing his craft at the prestigious Pasadena Playhouse. Stanton then toured around the United States with a male choir, worked in children's theater, and then headed back to California.His first role on screen was in the tepid movie O Festim da Morte (1957), but he was quickly noticed and appeared regularly in minor roles as cowboys and soldiers through the late 1950s and early 1960s. His star continued to rise and he received better roles in which he could showcase his laid-back style, such as in Rebeldia Indom\u00e1vel (1967), Os Guerreiros Pilantras (1970), Dillinger: Inimigo P\u00fablico n\u00ba 1 (1973), O Poderoso Chef\u00e3o II (1974), and in Alien, o Oitavo Passageiro (1979).

Next indie director Alex Cox gave Stanton a role that brought him to the forefront, in the quirky cult film Repo Man: A Onda Punk (1984).Stanton was now heavily in demand, and his unique look got him cast as everything from a suburban father in the mainstream A Garota de Rosa-Shocking (1986) to a soft-hearted, but ill-fated, private investigator in Cora\u00e7\u00e3o Selvagem (1990) and a crazy yet cunning scientist in Fuga de Nova York (1981). Apart from his film performances, he was also an accomplished musician, and \"The Harry Dean Stanton Band\" and their unique spin on mariachi music played together for well over a decade. They toured internationally. He became a cult figure of cinema and music and when Debbie Harry sang the lyric, \"I want to dance with Harry Dean...\" in her 1990s hit \"I Want That Man\", she was talking about him. Stanton remained consistently active on screen, most recently appearing in films including Medo e Del\u00edrio (1998), \u00c0 Espera de um Milagre (1999) and Porque Choram os Homens (2000).\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            firehouse44\n          \n\n", "realName": null, "height": "173"},

Her parents were farmers, and after the death of her father, she left for Paris where she found work with a modeling agency. She quickly made a name for herself, preferring a natural style and refusing to wear make-up. In the seventies,Louis Malle, searching for a new face and look, discovered Aurore on the cover of the French magazine Elle and cast her in the role of France, a young Jewish woman in love with a collaborator in the controversial Lacombe Lucien (1974). She then met Chantal Akerman and soon became one of her favorite comedians (from Os Encontros de Anna (1978) in which she plays a lonely movie director traveling all over Europe, to Demain on d\u00e9m\u00e9nage (2004) in which she portrays an intrusive and eccentric mother). In 1978 Aurore left for the Philippines to begin filming Apocalypse Now (1979), by Francis Ford Coppola, in which she was cast as the enigmatic and drug-addicted Roxanne who represented the typical 'femme fatale' for all French former colonists still dreaming of Indochina. However, the sequence, dubbed the 'Plantation', was unfortunately cut from the film and not seen again until the release of the Redux version in 2001. She met her husband, production designer Dean Tavoularis, while filming with Coppola. After several movies in Italy (Mario Monicelli, Dino Risi, Elio Petri) Aurore Clement was featured in two films shown in Cannes the same year. Portraying a loose woman for Claude Chabrol (Os Fantasmas do Chapeleiro (1982)) she totally reinvented herself and played a mysterious woman lost in the rain for Peter Del Monte \"L'invitation au Voyage\"). Two years later, she was cast by Wim Wenders as Dean Stockwell's wife in Paris, Texas (1984) which won the French Cannes Festival Palme d'Or. Excelling in playing both dramatic and lunatic characters, she reconnected with the 'cin\u00e9ma d'auteur', notably in Anne-Marie Mi\u00e9ville's Nous sommes tous encore ici (1997) in which she played the wife of Jean Luc Godard; in Laetitia Masson's distressing world (\u00c0 vendre (1998) , S\u00f3 Voc\u00ea (1994), La repentie (2002)), and in Serge Gainsbourg's nefarious and ultimate film, Um Homem Desinibido (1990). Aurore appeared also in well received and widely distributed movies such as Tanguy (2001), Viagem do Cora\u00e7\u00e3o (2003), and Jet Set (2000) before being directed again by Claude Chabrol as a cute hairdresser (A Dama de Honra (2004)) and by Sofia Coppola as the Duchess de Chartres in Maria Antonieta (2006). She has also been cast in numerous high quality films made for television such as Une p\u00e9niche nomm\u00e9e 'R\u00e9alit\u00e9' (1985) directed by Paul Seban (1982) in which she reconnects with her farming routes; Deux amies d'enfance (1983) with Ludmila Mika\u00ebl, directed by Nina Companeez (1983); \"Quidam\" (1984) in which director G\u00e9rard Marx casts her against type; Le regard dans le miroir (1985) directed by Jean Chapot (1985), in which she portrays a former camp survivor next to Bruno Cremer and Michel Bouquet; Les alsaciens - ou les deux Mathilde (1996), directed by Michel Favart, a film shown in two parts in which she plays a woman struggling and suffering throughout two world wars and \"Maigret et le corps sans t\u00eate\" (1991) in which she offers a stunning performance as a bar keeper in the mid-fifties rural France. She has also been recently seen in the series Zodiaque (2004) and Le ma\u00eetre du Zodiaque (2006). In addition to her film and television careers, Aurore has been a successful stage actress having first been seen in \"La Vie singuli\u00e8re d'Albert Nobbs\" (1988), directed by Simone Benmussa in which she portrays a young woman forced to disguise herself as a man in order to make a living in Victorian England. For this premiere on stage, she won an acting prize given by the French theater critics association. Ms. Clement was also seen in Anton Chekhov's \"La Mouette\", Marguerite Duras' \"Les Eaux et Forets\" and Alexandre Dumas fils' \"La Dame aux Camelias\", alongside Isabelle Adjani, for which she has been nominated for the Molieres (the equivalent of the American Tony's).\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            fgh@email.com\n          \n\n", "realName": "Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Aurore Louise Cl\u00e9ment", "height": "170"},

At university, Wenders originally studied to become a physician before switching to philosophy before terminating his studies in 1965. Moving to Paris, he intended to become a painter.He fell in love with the cinema but failed to gain admission to the French national film school. He supported himself as an engraver while attending movie houses. Upon his return to West Germany in 1967, he was employed by United Artists at its D\u00fcsseldorf office before he was accepted by the University of Television and Film Munich school for its autumn 1967 semester, where he remained until 1970. While attending film school, he worked as a newspaper film critic. In addition to shorts, he made a feature film as part of his studies, Summer in the City (1971).Wenders gained recognition as part of the German New Wave of the 1970s. Other directors that were part of the New German Cinema were Rainer Werner Fassbinder and Werner Herzog. His second feature, a film made from Peter Handke's novel O Medo do Goleiro Diante do P\u00eanalti (1972), brought him acclaim, as did Alice nas Cidades (1974) and No Decurso do Tempo (1976). It was his 1977 feature O Amigo Americano (1977) (\"The American Friend\"), starring Dennis Hopper as Patricia Highsmith's anti-hero Tom Ripley, that represented his international breakthrough. He was nominated for the Palme d'Or at the 1977 Cannes Film Festival for \"The American Friend\", which was cited as Best Foreign Film by the National Board of Review in the United States.Francis Ford Coppola, as producer, gave Wenders the chance to direct in America, but Hammett - Mist\u00e9rio em Chinatown (1982) (1982) was a critical and commercial failure. However, his American-made Paris, Texas (1984) (1984) received critical hosannas, wining three awards at Cannes, including the Palme d'Or, and Wenders won a BAFTA for best director. \"Paris, Texas\" was a prelude to his greatest success, 1987's Asas do Desejo (1987) (\"Wings of Desire\"), which he made back in Germany. The film brought him the best director award at Cannes and was a solid hit, even spawning an egregious Hollywood remake.Wenders followed it up with a critical and commercial flop in 1991, At\u00e9 o Fim do Mundo (1991) (\"Until the End of the World\"), though T\u00e3o Longe, T\u00e3o Perto (1993) won the Grand Prize of the Jury at Cannes. Still, is reputation as a feature film director never quite recovered in the United States after the bomb that was \"Until the End of the World.\" Since the mid-1990s, Wenders has distinguished himself as a non-fiction filmmaker, directing several highly acclaimed documentaries, most notably Buena Vista Social Club (1999) and Pina (2011), both of which brought him Oscar nominations.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Jon C.

His father, Timothy John Wroughton Craig, was a merchant seaman turned steel erector, and then became landlord of the \"Ring O'Bells\" pub in Frodsham, Cheshire. His mother, Carol Olivia (Williams), was an art teacher. Craig is of English, as well as Welsh, Scottish, and Irish, ancestry. His parents split up in 1972, and young Daniel was raised with his older sister, Lea, in Liverpool, then in Hoylake, Wirral, in the home of his mother. His interest in acting was encouraged by visits to the Liverpool Everyman Theatre arranged by his mother. From the age of 6, Craig started acting in school plays, making his debut in the Frodsham Primary School production of \"Oliver!\", and his mother was the driving force behind his artistic aspirations. The first Bond movie he ever saw at the cinema was Roger Moore's Com 007 Viva e Deixe Morrer (1973); young Daniel Craig saw it with his father, so it took a special place in his heart. He was also a good athlete and was a rugby player at Hoylake Rugby Club.At age 14, Craig played roles in \"Oliver\", \"Romeo and Juliet\" and \"Cinderella\" at Hilbre High School in West Kirby, Wirral. He left Hilbre High School at age 16 to audition at the National Youth Theatre's (NYT) troupe on their tour in Manchester in 1984. He was accepted and moved down to London. There, his mother and father watched his stage debut as Agamemnon in Shakespeare's \"Troilus and Cressida\". As a struggling actor with the NYT, he was toiling in restaurant kitchens and as a waiter. Craig performed with NYT on tours to Valencia, Spain, and to Moscow, Russia, under the leadership of director Edward Wilson. He failed at repeated auditions at the Guildhall, but eventually his persistence paid off, and in 1988, he entered the Guildhall School of Music and Drama at the Barbican. There, he studied alongside Ewan McGregor and Alistair McGowan, then later Damian Lewis and Joseph Fiennes, among others. He graduated in 1991, after a three-year course under the tutelage of Colin McCormack, the actor from the Royal Shakespeare Company. From 1992-1994, he was married to Scottish actress Fiona Loudon, their daughter, named Ella Craig (born 1992).Craig made his film debut in O Poder de um Jovem (1992). His film career continued on television, notably the BBC2 serial Our Friends in the North (1996). He shot to international fame after playing supporting roles in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and Estrada para Perdi\u00e7\u00e3o (2002). He was nominated for his performances in the leading role in Nem Tudo \u00e9 o Que Parece (2004), and received other awards and nominations. Craig was named as the sixth actor to portray James Bond, in October 2005, weeks after he finished his work in Munique (2005), where he co-starred with Eric Bana under the directorship of Steven Spielberg. Craig's reserved demeanor and his avoidance of the showbiz-party-red-carpet milieu makes him a cool 007. He is the first blond actor to play Bond, and also the first to be born after the start of the film series, and also the first to be born after the death of author Ian Fleming in 1964. Four of the past Bond actors: Sean Connery, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan have indicated that Craig is a good choice as Bond.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Steve Shelokhonov\n          \n\n", "realName": "Daniel Wroughton Craig", "height": "178"},

He spent the majority of his formative years in southern Florida, then moved with his family to Los Angeles when his career began to take off.Scott first became interested in acting in the third grade, when an actor gave a presentation for Career Day. He relentlessly pestered his parents to get him an agent until they finally realized that the young tyke was serious about becoming an actor. His first gig was a national commercial for Ideal Toys.In fall 1994, Scott left the LA scene to fulfill yet another dream--attending Harvard University. Taking leave of the TV series Tr\u00eas \u00c9 Demais (1987) didn't suggest he was leaving the business altogether.

Sunil Dutt wore many hats and excelled in a plethora of roles that came his way - both on and off screen.Born on June 6th, 1929, Sunil Dutt grew up as Balraj Dutt in a family that had survived the Partition of India. A student of Mumbai's Jai Hind college, he first started off as radio show host and celebrity interviewer, which led to his first encounter with the glamor world.Interestingly, wife-to-be Nargis was one of the celebrities he met in the course of his work. Soon, Dutt got a chance to enter the film-world, when director Ramesh Saigal offered him the hero's role in his Nalini Jaywant starrer 'Railway Platform' (1955).'Ek Hi Raasta' (1956), marked the start of a seven-film long association with B R Chopra. Dutt's true breakthrough came with Mehboob Khan's magnum opus 'Mother India' (1957).His portrayal of Birju, Nargi's rebellious younger son, portrayed a raw, urgent energy. Dutt's association with Nargis in the movie resulted in a more serious one, when he married her after the release of the film.Dutt's role in women-oriented films like 'Sadhna' (1958), 'Sujata' (1959) and 'Main Chup Rahungi' (1962) were well-appreciated. Noted filmmakers like Bimal Roy, Hrishikesh Mukherji and B R Chopra dared to defy Sunil Dutt's established rebellious Birju image and cast him as a sensitive lover.Dutt turned producer in the early sixties with a couple of offbeat movies - 'Yeh Raaste Hain Pyar Ke' (1963), where heroine Leela Naidu has an adulterous relationship and 'Mujhe Jeene Do' (1963) where he played a dacoit.In his cinematic association with B R Chopra, Dutt gave three big hits in the sixties - 'Gumraah' (1963), 'Waqt' (1965) and 'Humraaz' (1967). He also worked with South Indian filmmakers, which resulted in emotion-heavy, rural-based hits with Nutan like 'Khandaan' and 'Milan'.In 1967, he had a hat-trick of hits with 'Milan', 'Meherban' and 'Humraaz'. His role of a buffoon in Mehmood's 'Padosan' (1968) was much appreciated.In 1981, Dutt's world was rocked when his wife Nargis died after a protracted battle with her cancer. He later joined politics and social work.But the actor in Dutt continued to surface during the last decade with movies with select filmmakers like J P Dutta 'Kshatriya' and Yash Chopra 'Parampara'. His last screen cameo was in Rajkumar Hirani's immensely popular laugh riot 'Munnabhai MBBS', where he played on-screen father to his son Sanjay.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Arun\n          \n\n", "realName": "Balraj Dutt", "height": "178"},

He is best known for his 1966 masterpiece, The Battle of Algiers, widely viewed as one of the finest films of its genre: realistic though fictionalized documentary. Its portrayal of the Algerian resistance during the Algerian War uses the neorealist style pioneered by fellow Italian film directors de Santis and Rossellini, employing newsreel-style footage and non-professional actors, and focusing primarily on a disenfranchised population that seldom receives attention from the general media. Though very much Italian neorealist in style, Pontecorvo co-produced with an Algerian film company.The Battle of Algiers achieved great success and influence. It was widely screened in the United States, where Pontecorvo received a number of awards. He was also nominated for two Academy Awards.Pontecorvo's next major work, Queimada! (Burn!, 1969), is also anti-colonial, this time set in the Antilles. This film (starring Marlon Brando) depicts an attempted revolution of the oppressed. Pontecorvo continued his series of highly political films with Ogro (1979), which addresses the occurrence of terrorism at the end of Francisco Franco's dwindling regime in Spain.In 2006, he died from congestive heart failure in Rome at age 86.\n\n- IMDb Mini Biography By: \n          \n            Pedro Borges\n          \n\n", "realName": "Gilberto Pontecorvo", "height": null},

He landed the role of Danny Zuko in his school production of \"Grease.\" After that, the acting bug sank in and the next three years he spent time doing local theater. Around 16, he and his mother went to New York City to find an agent and possible auditions. A year later, he was cast in an off-Broadway play called \"Finding the Sun.\" After doing another play called \"Shenandoah\" in 1994, James received an academic scholarship to Drew University in NJ, where he was working towards obtaining a major in English with a minor in sociology and also at that time he won the role of Rick Sanford in the movie Angus - O Comil\u00e3o (1995).
